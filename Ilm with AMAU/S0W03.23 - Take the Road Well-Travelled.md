**Take the road that has produced hundreds of thousands of scholars throughout history.**

# Insights From Ustadh’s Journey of Seeking Knowledge
[00:37](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578979&permalink=23-take-the-road-well-travelled#00:37) 

[[Sh. Muhammad Tim Humble]] mentions that during his time at university, he saw a large discrepancy in the level of the students, that did not necessarily correlate to their grades or academic achievements.

From the common problems that he observed:
- Lack of a wide base
- Specialisation too early
- Studying from student notes rather than a matn
- Lack of memorisation
- Lack of studying outside of the university
- Conversely, studying outside of the university without a plan

And so he reflected as to whether or not there was a common method that those who were successful followed.

He came across two things that affirmed that there is a basic and clear method that produces successful students:

1. The curriculum of Daar al-Hadeeth al-Khayriyyah in Makkah
	- From middle school to university. 
	- Studied whole books, covering the major sciences.
	
2. Some notes from a fellow student regarding a structured curriculum for seeking knowledge

From books that helped him on this topic:
- [[Hiliyat Taalib al-Ilm]] by shaykh [[Bakr Abu Zayd]] - though it is difficult to extract the method from the book, rather you should know the method first and then read the book
- [[Ta'dheem al-Ilm]]  by shaykh [[Salih al 'Usaymi]] - Easiest book that he has seen that summarises and addresses the problem.

# Summarising the method

## Lines of Poetry Outlining the Knowledge Roadmap

Benefit of poetry - condenses a lot of information into a few lines that are easy to memorise. These lines act as keys to the rest of ones knowledge on the topic. 

**The following lines of poetry should be memorised:**

> [!poem] 
> 
> فَمَا حَوَى الْغَايَةَ فِي أَلْفِ سَنَةٍ ... شَخْصٌ فَخُذْ مِنْ كُلِّ فَنٍّ أَحْسَنَهُ،
> 
> A person could not complete the goal in a thousand years,  
> ... So take from every science the best of it,
> 
> بِحِفْظِ مَتْنٍ جَامِعٍ لِلرَّاجِحِ ... تَأْخُذُهُ عَلَىٰ مُفِيدٍ نَاصِحٍ.
> 
> by memorising a text that gathers the strongest positions,  
> ... taking it from a beneficial, sincere (teacher).
> 
> {{ Ad-Daleel ilaa al-Mutūn al-‘Ilmiyyah – Page 58 }}

## An Overview of the Knowledge Roadmap

The Problem: 

- **Time is limited and knowledge is vast**. 1000 years wouldn't be enough to finish everything.

The solution:

- **You must be selective**. You cannot study every book in every science.
- **You need a short and proven road**. This does not mean rushing, but means being efficient.
- **Avoid superfluous study**. Be focused on the path, and do not be distracted by anything that is not needed.
- **Follow a curriculum that is well-tested**

## Key Features of the Road

Will be discussed in detail in later lessons. In brief:

- **Covers all of the Islamic sciences**
- **Chooses the best books** at each level and at each science
- **Covers the mutoon / primers** - comprehensive and concise texts
- These mutoon must be **proven texts**, avoiding rare/obscure texts

> [!quote] [[Imam Maalik]] said (regarding Hadith, but the point applies generally)
> 
> قَالَ مَالِكُ بْنُ أَنَسٍ:  
> شَرُّ الْعِلْمِ الْغَرِيبُ، وَخَيْرُ الْعِلْمِ الظَّاهِرُ الَّذِي قَدْ رَوَاهُ النَّاسُ.
> 
> “The worst kind of knowledge is that which is rare, and the best kind of knowledge is that which is clear, narrated by the people.”
> 
> الْجَامِعُ لِأَخْلَاقِ الرَّاوِي وَآدَابِ السَّامِعِ لِلْخَطِيبِ الْبَغْدَادِيِّ (٢ / ١٠٠)

- **Memorisation is required**, to act as a key that opens open the doors to the rest of knowledge studied on the topic.
- Requires a **qualified nurturing teacher**.
