# Tawheed  | التوحيد

**We were created to worship Allah alone:**

> [!quran] [[Al-Dhaariyat]] ([[51-56]]) 
> 
> وَمَا خَلَقْتُ ٱلْجِنَّ وَٱلْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ ٥٦
> 
> And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.

**Every single Prophet came with this message**:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nahl]] ([[16-36]]) 
> 
> ==وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍۢ رَّسُولًا أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ ٱلطَّـٰغُوتَ ۖ== فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةُ ۚ فَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ٣٦
> 
> **And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], "Worship Allāh and avoid ṭāghūt."** And among them were those whom Allāh guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed [i.e., travel] through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.

And this is what is meant in the ayah that we recite in every rak'ah of every prayer:

> [!quran] [[Al-Fatiha]] ([[1-5]]) 
> 
> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ ٥
> 
> It is You we worship and You we ask for help.

**This is the only thing we have been commanded,** and everything else falls under it:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Bayyinah]] ([[98-5]]) 
> 
> ==وَمَآ أُمِرُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ حُنَفَآءَ== وَيُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ ٱلْقَيِّمَةِ ٥
> 
> And they were not commanded except to worship Allāh, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakāh. And that is the correct religion.

## The Meaning of Tawheed

**Linguistic meaning**

From:  وَحَّدَة يُوَحِّدُ

> "To make something one/to declare something one"

**Shar'i meaning**

> "To single Allah out as one"

## Dividing Tawheed into Two Categories

1. **Tawheed of knowledge and affirmation** | توحيد المعرفة والإثبات

What is required here is knowledge and affirmation/belief (that Allah is one in his Names, and Attributes, and actions)

And this is the Tawheed that is mentioned in the ayah:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Talaq]] ([[65-12]])
> 
> ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـٰوَٰتٍۢ وَمِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ ٱلْأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ ==لِتَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌۭ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًۢا== ١٢
> 
> It is Allāh who has created seven heavens and of the earth, the like of them. [His] command descends among them **so you may know that Allāh is over all things competent and that Allāh has encompassed all things in knowledge.**

2. **Tawheed of action** | التوحيد العملي 

Can also be called:
	Tawheed  of worship | توحيد العبادة
	Tawheed of your object of worship / divinity | توحيد الإلهية
	Tawheed of worship | توحيد الألوهية

The requirement here category is to act, by directing all of ones worship to Allah alone

This is the Tawheed mentioned in the ayah:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Dhaariyat]] ([[51:56]])
> 
> وَمَا خَلَقْتُ ٱلْجِنَّ وَٱلْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ ٥٦
> 
> And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.

## Dividing Tawheed into Three Categories

This is the same as the aforementioned division into two, except that the fist category (توحيد المعرفة والإثبات) is itself divided into two:

1. **Tawheed of lordship** | توحيد الربوبية 

This encompasses all aspects of the Lordship of Allah - He is the creator, giver of life, taker of life and so on

*Tawheed in what Allah does.*

2. **Tawheed of Allahs names and attributes** | توحيد الأسماء والصفات

This is the belief that all of the perfect names and  attributes of Allah are only for Him alone.

*Tawheed in what Allah is.*

3. **Tawheed of worship** | توحيد الألوهية

*Tawheed in our actions*, and this is the same as in the division into two

## Evidence for these categories

They are found throughout the Quran. 

For example, in the verses that people are most familiar with:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Fatiha]]
> الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
> 
> الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ
> 
> مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ
> 
> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ

Note, {{ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ }} alone contains all three categories
1. Lordship - رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
2. Names - Allah and Rab
3. Worship - الْحَمْدُ (act of worship) & لِلَّهِ (Allah means the one who deserves worship)

Or the two categories
1. Knowing Allah - Allah,  رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
2. Worship/action - الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ

So this division is found even in the first Ayah of the Quran.

Looking at the remaining verses:
1. Lordship - مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ
2. Names and Attributes - الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ / مَالِكِ
3. Worship - إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ

**And likewise they are mentioned together in one ayah that can be memorised:**

> [!quran] [[Maryam]] ([[19-65]]) 
> 
> ==رَّبُّ== ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ==فَٱعْبُدْهُ== وَٱصْطَبِرْ لِعِبَـٰدَتِهِۦ ۚ ==هَلْ تَعْلَمُ لَهُۥ سَمِيًّۭا== ٦٥
> 
> **Lord of the heavens and the earth** and whatever is between them - so **worship Him** and have patience for His worship. **Do you know of any similarity to Him (in names and attributes)**?"

**They are mentioned in the first command of the Quran:**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] ([[2-21]]) 
> 
> يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ==ٱعْبُدُوا۟ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ== وَٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ ٢١
> 
> O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -

And there is not an ayah on Tawheed in the Quran except that it displays this categorisation.

## Relationship between the categories

There is a bi-directional relationship between Tawheed of Knowledge and Tawheed of Action:

1. **Knowledge leads to action**

2. **Action encompasses knowledge** (because action cannot exist without knowledge)

Looking again at Surah [[Al-Fatiha]]:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Fatiha]]
> الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
> 
> الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ
> 
> مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ
> 
> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ

The first verses lead to "إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ".

And if you are following "إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ", then you must have understanding of the preceding verses.

## The primary message of the Prophets was Tawheed of worship

**The Prophets came with both categories of Tawheed, but their focus and argument was Tawheed of worship.**

This is because:
2. Tawheed of worship encompasses tawheed of knowledge
3. The people did not deny Tawheed of Knowledge, even if they were not perfect

To be clear: It is not precise to say that Quraysh had Tawheed al-Rububiyyah. Rather, they had mistakes in it, but Tawheed al-Rubibiyyah was not a fight for them. Their problem was with the call to Tawheed of Worship.

**Their issue was not with Tawheed of knowledge:**

> [!quran] [[Luqman]] ([[31-25]]) 
> 
> وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ ۚ قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ٢٥
> 
> And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and earth?" they would surely say, "Allāh." Say, "[All] praise is [due] to Allāh"; but most of them do not know.

**Their issue was with Tawheed of worship:**

> [!Quran] [[Saad]] ([[38-5]]) 
> 
> أَجَعَلَ ٱلْـَٔالِهَةَ إِلَـٰهًۭا وَٰحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَـٰذَا لَشَىْءٌ عُجَابٌۭ ٥
> 
> Has he made the gods [only] one God? Indeed, this is a curious thing."

In order to use Saad ayah 5 as an evidence, we must prove the meaning of ilaah:

**Ilah means ma'bud (something worshipped):**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Zukhruf]] ([[43-45]]) 
> 
> وَسْـَٔلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ءَالِهَةًۭ يُعْبَدُونَ ٤٥
> 
> And ask those We sent before you of Our messengers; have We made besides the Most Merciful deities to be worshipped?

**The meaning of the tahleel**:
> لَا إِلَهَ ==بِحَقٍّ== إِلَّا اللهُ

There is none that ==truly deserves== to be worshipped except for Allah 

"Truly deserves", because it is not negating that there are things worshipped besides Allah. It negates that those things are deserving of worship.

# The opposite of Tawheed is Shirk

## The Meaning of Shirk

The most simple & comprehensive definition for shirk (should be memorised) is:

> صَرفُ حَقٍ مِن حُقُوقِ اللهِ لِغَيرِهِ

**"To give one or more of the rights of Allah to something/someone else."**

For every example and category of Tawheed, there is an example and category of shirk.

## The punishment for shirk

**Shirk prevents a person from Jannah:**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ma'idah]] ([[5-72]]) 
> 
> لَقَدْ كَفَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ هُوَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ ۖ وَقَالَ ٱلْمَسِيحُ يَـٰبَنِىٓ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبَّكُمْ ۖ ==إِنَّهُۥ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَىٰهُ ٱلنَّارُ ۖ وَمَا لِلظَّـٰلِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍۢ ٧٢==
> 
> They have certainly disbelieved who say, "Allāh is the Messiah, the son of Mary" while the Messiah has said, "O Children of Israel, worship Allāh, my Lord and your Lord." **Indeed, he who associates others with Allāh - Allāh has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers**.

**Shirk nullifies all a persons good deeds:**

> [!quran] [[Al-Zumar]] ([[39-65]], [[39-66]]) 
> 
> وَلَقَدْ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ ٱلْخَـٰسِرِينَ ٦٥
> 
> And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allāh, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.
> 
> بَلِ ٱللَّهَ فَٱعْبُدْ وَكُن مِّنَ ٱلشَّـٰكِرِينَ ٦٦
> 
> Rather, worship [only] Allāh and be among the grateful.

**Allah does not forgive shirk (for the person who dies upon it):**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4-48]]) 
> 
> ==إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ== وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا ٤٨
> 
> Indeed, Allāh does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allāh has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.

And the beginning of the ayah is repeated in the surah:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4-116]]) 
> 
> ==إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ== وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَـٰلًۢا بَعِيدًا ١١٦
> 
> Indeed, Allāh does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allāh has certainly gone far astray.

NOTE: Allah can forgive the one who repents before they die:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Zumar]] ([[39-53]]) 
> 
> ۞ قُلْ يَـٰعِبَادِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا۟ مِن رَّحْمَةِ ٱللَّهِ ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا ۚ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْغَفُورُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ ٥٣
> 
> Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh forgives  all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."

## The categories of shirk

**Greater Shirk** | شرك أكبر

The default type - the shirk that takes the person outside of the fold of Islam, wipes out all of their deeds, and prevents them from Jannah permanently.

---

**Lesser Shirk** | شرك أصغر

Shirk where we have a proof that it does not take the person outside of the fold of Islam

The primary example is showing off, but minor shirk is not limited to this.

---

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4-48]]) 
> 
> ==إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ== وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا ٤٨
> 
> Indeed, Allāh does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allāh has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.

There is difference as to which type of shirk this refers to.

- Some say that it is major shirk.
- Others said this statement applies to both minor and major shirk, but that:
	- the person who dies upon major shirk will not be forgiven and will go to hell forever
	- the person who dies upon minor shirk will not be forgiven but will not go to hell forever.

**Generally speaking, shirk is the worst of the major sins:**

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] said
> 
> لَأَنْ أَحْلِفَ باللهِ كَاذِبًا أَحَبُّ إلَيَّ مِن أَنْ أحْلِفَ بِغَيْرِ اللّهِ صَادِقًا
> 
> To swear by Allah falsely is more beloved to me than to swear by other than Allah truthfully.

Where swearing by other than Allah is minor shirk

**Lesser shirk returns to three things**:

1. That which resembles greater shirk (eg showing off)
2. That which leads to greater shirk (eg ta'eedh)
3. Attaching oneself to a means that Allah has not made a means in either in the shari'ah or qadr
