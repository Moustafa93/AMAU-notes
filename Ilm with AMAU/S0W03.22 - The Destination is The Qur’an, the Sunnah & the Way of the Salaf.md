# The Wrong Destination
[0:00](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578978&permalink=22-destination-the-quran-the-sunnah-the-way-of-the-salaf#0:00) 

From the Wrong Destinations / Incorrect goals are:

**Becoming an Academic** (Accumulating knowledge for knowledge's sake)

If this knowledge is not bringing you closer to Allah, then it is of no benefit.

**Finishing a certain list of books**

The map is incomplete. You finish these books, but then what? You will be burnt out and have no next step.

**Being a Scholar**

This is poorly defined. You will not know when you have reached this goal.

# The Only Correct Destination
[5:20](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578978&permalink=22-destination-the-quran-the-sunnah-the-way-of-the-salaf#5:20) 

**To understand and implement the Qur'an and the Sunnah the way that the Companions did.**

That is a goal that can define every step of the journey. Every book, teacher, course, curriculum have to be on that goal.

It ensures that sincerity, the correct understanding and action are all there. 

## Evidence for Following the Qur'an
[8:03](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578978&permalink=22-destination-the-quran-the-sunnah-the-way-of-the-salaf#8:03) 

There are many evidences for this. From them:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Isra]] ([[17-9]])
> 
> إِنَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ يَهْدِى لِلَّتِى هِىَ أَقْوَمُ وَيُبَشِّرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًۭا كَبِيرًۭا ٩
> 
> Indeed, this Qur’ān guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward

This is a comprehensive ayah that is good to memorise.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Zumar]] ([[39-1]] to [[39-2]])
> 
> [[39-1]]
> تَنزِيلُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْعَزِيزِ ٱلْحَكِيمِ ١
> 
> The revelation of the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] is from Allāh, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
> 
> 
> 
> [[39-2]]
> إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ بِٱلْحَقِّ فَٱعْبُدِ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصًۭا لَّهُ ٱلدِّينَ ٢
> 
> Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book, [O Muḥammad], in truth. So worship Allāh, [being] sincere to Him in religion.

From the benefits:
- This Quran came down from Allah - it is not the speech of a person
- It tells you how to worship Allah correctly.
- It tells you how to be sincere

> [!Quran] [[Al-Naml]] ([[27-1]] to 3)
> 
> [[27-1]]
> طسٓ ۚ تِلْكَ ءَايَـٰتُ ٱلْقُرْءَانِ وَكِتَابٍۢ مُّبِينٍ ١
> 
> Ṭā, Seen. These are the verses of the Qur’ān [i.e., recitation] and a clear Book
> 
> [[27-2]]
> هُدًۭى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٢
> 
> As guidance and good tidings for the believers
> 
> [[27-3]]
> ٱلَّذِينَ يُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَهُم بِٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ ٣
> 
> Who establish prayer and give zakāh, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].

**Turning away from Revelation causes a person to have a miserable life in the dunya and akhira:**

> [!quran] [[Ta-Ha]] ([[20-124]] to [[20-127]]) 
> 
> [[20-124]] 
> وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِى فَإِنَّ لَهُۥ مَعِيشَةًۭ ضَنكًۭا وَنَحْشُرُهُۥ يَوْمَ ٱلْقِيَـٰمَةِ أَعْمَىٰ ١٢٤
> 
> And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed [i.e., difficult] life, and We will gather [i.e., raise] him on the Day of Resurrection blind."
> 
> [[20-125]] 
> قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِىٓ أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيرًۭا ١٢٥
> 
> He will say, "My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I was [once] seeing?"
> 
> [[20-126]] 
> قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ ءَايَـٰتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا ۖ وَكَذَٰلِكَ ٱلْيَوْمَ تُنسَىٰ ١٢٦
> 
> [Allāh] will say, "Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot [i.e., disregarded] them; and thus will you this Day be forgotten."
> 
> [[20-127]] 
> وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِى مَنْ أَسْرَفَ وَلَمْ يُؤْمِنۢ بِـَٔايَـٰتِ رَبِّهِۦ ۚ وَلَعَذَابُ ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ أَشَدُّ وَأَبْقَىٰٓ ١٢٧
> 
> And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring.

(To forget here means to abandon.)

**The summary of these evidences: Whoever follows the Quran is guided, and whoever turns away from it is astray.**

## Evidence for Following the Sunnah
[12:32](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578978&permalink=22-destination-the-quran-the-sunnah-the-way-of-the-salaf#12:32) 

**We are instructed to follow both the Quran and the Hikmah sent down to the Prophet** ﷺ:

> [!quran] [[Aal 'Imran]] ([[3-164]]) 
> 
> لَقَدْ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَى ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ بَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رَسُولًۭا مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ يَتْلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـٰتِهِۦ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُوا۟ مِن قَبْلُ لَفِى ضَلَـٰلٍۢ مُّبِينٍ ١٦٤
> 
> Certainly did Allāh confer [great] favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] and wisdom, although they had been before in manifest error.

Both are needed to achieve knowledge and purity and righteousness.

**That Hikmah did not come from him** ﷺ, **but it was a second revelation from Allah**:

> [!quran] [[Al-Najm]] ([[53-1]] to 4) 
> 
> [[53-1]] 
> وَٱلنَّجْمِ إِذَا هَوَىٰ ١
> 
> By the star when it descends,
> 
> [[53-2]] 
> مَا ضَلَّ صَاحِبُكُمْ وَمَا غَوَىٰ ٢
> 
> Your companion [i.e., Muḥammad] has not strayed, nor has he erred,
> 
> [[53-3]] 
> وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ ٱلْهَوَىٰٓ ٣
> 
> Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination.
> 
> [[53-4]] 
> إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْىٌۭ يُوحَىٰ ٤
> 
> It is not but a revelation revealed,

> [!Hadith] [[Al-Miqdam ibn Ma'dikarib]] narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> 
> عَنْ الْمِقْدَامِ بْنِ مَعْدِي كَرِبٍ قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ:
> 
> أَلَا إِنِّي أُوتِيتُ الْقُرْآنَ وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ، أَلَا يُوشِكُ رَجُلٌ شَبْعَانُ عَلَىٰ أَرِيكَتِهِ يَقُولُ: عَلَيْكُمْ بِهَذَا الْقُرْآنِ، فَمَا وَجَدْتُمْ فِيهِ مِنْ حَلَالٍ فَأَحِلُّوهُ، وَمَا وَجَدْتُمْ فِيهِ مِنْ حَرَامٍ فَحَرِّمُوهُ، وَإِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ كَمَا حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ…
> 
> “Indeed, I have been given the Qur’an and something like it along with it.
> 
> Soon, a man will recline on his couch, full, and say: ‘Stick to this Qur’an; whatever you find in it to be lawful, consider lawful, and whatever you find in it to be unlawful, consider unlawful.’
> 
> Yet whatever the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has declared unlawful is just as Allah has declared unlawful.”
> 
> {مَصَابِيحُ السُّنَّةِ لِلْبَغَوِيِّ (١٢٧)}

> [!hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Aas]:
> 
> كُنْتُ أَكْتُبُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ أَسْمَعُهُ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم أُرِيدُ حِفْظَهُ فَنَهَتْنِي قُرَيْشٌ وَقَالُوا أَتَكْتُبُ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ تَسْمَعُهُ وَرَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم بَشَرٌ يَتَكَلَّمُ فِي الْغَضَبِ وَالرِّضَا فَأَمْسَكْتُ عَنِ الْكِتَابِ فَذَكَرْتُ ذَلِكَ لِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَأَوْمَأَ بِأُصْبُعِهِ إِلَى فِيهِ فَقَالَ:
> 
> ‏ =="‏ اكْتُبْ فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ مَا يَخْرُجُ مِنْهُ إِلاَّ حَقٌّ ‏"‏== ‏.‏
> 
> I used to write everything which I heard from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). I intended (by it) to memorise it. The Quraysh prohibited me saying: Do you write everything that you hear from him while the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is a human being: he speaks in anger and pleasure? So I stopped writing, and mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He signalled with his finger to him mouth and said: 
> 
> "**Write, by Him in Whose hand my soul lies, only right comes out from it**."
> 
> {{ Sunan Abi Dawud 3646 }}

> [!quran] [[Al-Zukhruf]] ([[43-43]]) 
> 
> فَٱسْتَمْسِكْ بِٱلَّذِىٓ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍۢ مُّسْتَقِيمٍۢ ٤٣
> 
> So adhere to that which is revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a straight path.

The sirat al mustaqim is holding onto the Quran and the Sunnah
## Evidence for the Need to Act Upon Knowledge
[17:05](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578978&permalink=22-destination-the-quran-the-sunnah-the-way-of-the-salaf#17:05) 

Knowledge is not sought for its own sake, but it is sought to be implemented.

> [!quran] [[Al-Fath]] ([[48-28]]) 
> 
> هُوَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُۥ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ وَدِينِ ٱلْحَقِّ لِيُظْهِرَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلدِّينِ كُلِّهِۦ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِٱللَّهِ شَهِيدًۭا ٢٨
> 
> It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. And sufficient is Allāh as Witness.

> [!quote] [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] said regarding this ayah:
> 
> وَالْخَيْرُ وَالسَّعَادَةُ وَالْكَمَالُ وَالصَّلَاحُ مُنْحَصِرٌ فِي نَوْعَيْنِ:  
> فِي الْعِلْمِ النَّافِعِ، وَالْعَمَلِ الصَّالِحِ.  
> وَقَدْ بَعَثَ اللَّهُ مُحَمَّدًا ﷺ بِأَفْضَلِ ذَلِكَ،  
> وَهُوَ الْهُدَىٰ وَدِينُ الْحَقِّ.
> 
> Goodness, happiness, perfection, and rectitude are confined to two types: beneficial knowledge and righteous action. And Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ with the best of that, and it is guidance and the religion of truth.
> 
> {{ Majmoo’ Al-Fataawa – Ibn Taymiyyah (19 / 169–170) }}

So the ayah refers to beneficial knowledge and righteous action.

## Evidence for Following the Sahabah
[18:46](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578978&permalink=22-destination-the-quran-the-sunnah-the-way-of-the-salaf#18:46) 

We need to understand the Quran and Sunnah correctly as the Companions did.

From the many evidences:

**Guidance is measured by your Iman being like the Iman of the Sahaba**:

> [!quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] ([[2-137]]) 
> 
> ==فَإِنْ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِمِثْلِ مَآ ءَامَنتُم بِهِۦ== فَقَدِ ٱهْتَدَوا۟ ۖ وَّإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِى شِقَاقٍۢ ۖ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ۚ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلْعَلِيمُ ١٣٧
> 
> **So if they believe in the same as you (all) believe in**, then they have been [rightly] guided; but if they turn away, they are only in dissension, and Allāh will be sufficient for you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

Note: "مَآ ءَامَنتُم" is plural. This indicates that is not referring to the Prophet (ﷺ), but rather it is addressing the companions.

So if the new people to Islam have an Iman like the people in Islam when the ayah was revealed (the companions), then they are rightly guided.

So in this ayah Allah made guidance dependent upon your Iman being like the Iman of the companions. And that means in knowledge and action, as Iman covers both. 

**Misguidance is measured in opposition to the Prophet** ﷺ **AND opposition to the Sahaba:**

> [!quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4-115]]) 
> 
> وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِۦ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِۦ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَسَآءَتْ مَصِيرًا ١١٥
> 
> And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination.

"The believers" at the time this ayah was revealed were the companions.

**The goodness of this Ummah has been placed in its early part**:

> [!Hadith] [[Imran ibn Hussain]] narrated that The Prophet ﷺ said:
> 
> خَيْرُكُمْ قَرْنِي، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ، ثُمَّ الَّذِينَ يَلُونَهُمْ
> 
> The best people are those living in my generation, then those coming after them, and then those coming after them.
> 
> {{ Sahih al-Bukhari 2651 }}

**The safety of this Ummah has been placed in its early part**:

> [!hadith] [[Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Aas]] narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:
> 
> ‏ "‏إِنَّهُ لَمْ يَكُنْ نَبِيٌّ قَبْلِي إِلاَّ كَانَ حَقًّا عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَدُلَّ أُمَّتَهُ عَلَى مَا يَعْلَمُهُ خَيْرًا لَهُمْ وَيُنْذِرَهُمْ مَا يَعْلَمُهُ شَرًّا لَهُمْ ==وَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكُمْ هَذِهِ جُعِلَتْ عَافِيَتُهَا فِي أَوَّلِهَا== ... ‏"‏ ‏‏
> 
> There has a never been a prophet before me who was not obliged to tell his nation of what he knew was good for them, and to warn against that he knew was bad for them. With regard to Ummah of yours, ==safety has been placed in its earlier generations==...
> 
> {{ Sunan an-Nasa'i 4191 }}

**The Prophet** ﷺ **explicitly instructed us to follow the Companions:**

> [!Hadith] From the Hadith of [[al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah]]
> 
> فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ يَعِشْ مِنْكُمْ فَسَيَرَى اخْتِلَافًا كَثِيرًا، فَعَلَيْكُمْ بِسُنَّتِي ==وَسُنَّةِ الْخُلَفَاءِ الرَّاشِدِينَ الْمَهْدِيينَ==، عَضُّوا عَلَيْهَا بِالنَّوَاجِذِ، وَإِيَّاكُمْ وَمُحْدَثَاتِ الْأُمُورِ؛ فَإِنَّ كُلَّ بِدْعَةٍ ضَلَالَةٌ
> 
> Verily he among you who lives long will see great controversy, so you must keep to my Sunnah **and to the Sunnah of the Khulafa ar-Rashideen (the rightly guided caliphs),** those who guide to the right way. Cling to it stubbornly [literally: with your molar teeth]. Beware of newly invented matters [in the religion], for verily every bidah (innovation) is misguidance.
> 
> https://sunnah.com/nawawi40:28

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Aas]] that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said
> 
> لَيَأْتِيَنَّ عَلَى أُمَّتِي مَا أَتَى عَلَى بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ حَذْوَ النَّعْلِ بِالنَّعْلِ حَتَّى إِنْ كَانَ مِنْهُمْ مَنْ أَتَى أُمَّهُ عَلاَنِيَةً لَكَانَ فِي أُمَّتِي مَنْ يَصْنَعُ ذَلِكَ وَإِنَّ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ تَفَرَّقَتْ عَلَى ثِنْتَيْنِ وَسَبْعِينَ مِلَّةً وَتَفْتَرِقُ أُمَّتِي عَلَى ثَلاَثٍ وَسَبْعِينَ مِلَّةً كُلُّهُمْ فِي النَّارِ إِلاَّ مِلَّةً وَاحِدَةً قَالُوا وَمَنْ هِيَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ قَالَ ==مَا أَنَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَصْحَابِي==
> 
> "What befell the children of Isra'il will befall my Ummah, step by step, such that if there was one who had intercourse with his mother in the open, then there would be someone from my Ummah who would do that. Indeed the children of Isra'il split into seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will split into seventy-three sects. All of them are in the Fire Except one sect." He said: "And which is it O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "**What I am upon and my Companions**."
> 
> {{ Jaami' Tirmidhi 2641 }}

**So following the salaf cannot possibly be wrong, and this is not a matter of ijtihad.**
