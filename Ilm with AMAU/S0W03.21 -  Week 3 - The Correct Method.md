# Why a Method Matters
[00:41](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578977&permalink=21-week-3-goal-the-correct-method#00:41) 

Sincerity & Motivation are not enough alone.

A car with plenty of fuel will not reach its destination if the driver does not know the way.

Likewise, a road map is needed in seeking knowledge. 

Lacking a road map can erode motivation over time. It could lead to total failure, or it could limit the distance a person can travel or how quickly they make progress.

> In the tafseer of surah [[al-Mulk]] [[67-2]] {لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۚ}, he said:
> 
> وَقَالَ فُضَيْلُ بْنُ عِيَاضٍ: «أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا: أَخْلَصُهُ وَأَصْوَبُهُ».  
> وَقَالَ: العَمَلُ لَا يُقْبَلُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ خَالِصًا صَوَابًا؛  
> الخَالِصُ: إِذَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ،  
> وَالصَّوَابُ: إِذَا كَانَ عَلَى السُّنَّةِ.

> The best deed is that which is most sincere and most correct.

> A deed is not accepted until it is sincere and done the right way
> Sincere: meaning it is for Allah
> And done the right way: meaning it is in accordance with the Sunnah.

# The Path is Well Defined

What is needed is the fastest, shortest, proven route to our destination. (In reality, there is no final destination, as when each stage is reached, there is another stage to work towards).

Such a  path to seeking knowledge is well known to the scholars, though it may not be common knowledge among everyone who has set out on the path of knowledge.

Though they may differ slightly, their methods has surprisingly little variation.

And when the road to knowledge becomes clear, this is a  large relief for the student of knowledge.
