As the poet said:
> بِحِفْظِ مَتْنٍ جَامِعٍ لِلرَّاجِحِ

So this lesson is regarding the importance and place for memorisation on the road-map. The details of the method of memorisation will be discussed in the Hifdh with AMAU program.

The balance between memorisation and understanding is essential, and deficiency in this balance is a major reason for failure.

# The Importance of Memorisation
[3:18](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#3:18) 

Memorisation is the ability to recall speech on demand.

> [!quran] [[Al-'Ankabut]] ([[29-49]]) 
> 
> بَلْ هُوَ ءَايَـٰتٌۢ بَيِّنَـٰتٌۭ فِى صُدُورِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ ۚ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَٔايَـٰتِنَآ إِلَّا ٱلظَّـٰلِمُونَ ٤٩
> 
> Rather, it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is distinct verses [preserved] within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers.

Here, the Quran is described as being within the chest, not within the pages. This emphasises importance of memorisation.

## The Importance of Memorisation of Qur'an
[4:54](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#4:54) 

**By default, memorisation of the Quran must be the priority.**

It should be the beginning of the journey, and it is the ultimate goal of the journey. Moreover, it will stay with you throughout the journey.

Being a Hafidh will aid with studying the Islamic sciences. This is not limited to Tafseer, as the Quran gathers all the sciences within it.

**The Quran is easy to memorise**:

> [!quran] [[Al-Qamar]] ([[54-17]]) 
> 
> وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍۢ ١٧
> 
> And We have certainly made the Qur’ān easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?

So becoming a hafidh is something that is within everyone's reach.

**The Salaf considered Hifdh a prerequisite to seeking knowledge:**

> [!quote] If Imam [[Al-Awzaa'i]] saw a young boy in his gathering he would say:
> 
> قَرَأْي فِينَا حَدَّثَنَا قَالَ: يَا غُلَامُ، قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْآنَ؟  
> 
> فَإِنْ قَالَ: نَعَمْ، قَالَ: اقْرَأْ «يُوصِيكُمُ اللَّهُ فِي أَوْلَادِكُمْ».  
> 
> فَإِنْ قَالَ: لَا، قَالَ: اذْهَبْ تَعَلَّمِ الْقُرْآنَ قَبْلَ أَنْ تَطْلُبَ الْعِلْمَ.
> 
> “O young boy, have you memorised the Qur’an?”  
> 
> If he said, “Yes,” he said: “Then recite: _‘Allah instructs you concerning your children.’_  (i.e. to test his memorisation with a difficult section of the Quran)
> 
> And if he said, “No,” he said: “Then go and learn the Qur’an before you seek knowledge.”
> 
> {{ Al-Jaamiʿ li Akhlaaq ar-Raawi wa Aadaab as-Saamiʿ (1/108) }}

Hence why Itqan has Hifdh as a pre-requisite.

## AMAU Qur'an Memorisation Requirements 

**The Ideal Goal**

To complete memorisation of the Qur'an by the end of the 5 years.

**The Minimum Standard**

- The Mufassal Surahs ([[Qaf]] to [[Al-Naas]]) | المفصل
- [[Al-Hujurat]] (added to the Mufassal)
- [[Al-Sajdah]] (Because the Prophet ﷺ would lead with it in the first rak'ah of Fajr on Jumu'ah)
- [[Al-Kahf]] (because of the benefit of reading it once a week)

**Why this minimum standard?**

The Mufassal is what the Prophet ﷺ led the payer with most of the time:
- Fajr: Longer Mufassal Surahs
- Dhuhr, Asr & Ishaa': Medium Surahs
- Maghrib: Shorter Surahs (from [[Al-Duha]] to [[Al-Naas]])
(Of course he would sometimes lead with longer surahs also)

So memorising these surahs would qualify a person to lead the prayer in their community, though being a hafidh would be ideal.

## How the Salaf Viewed Memorisation
[16:06](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#16:06) 

**The salaf viewed knowledge as that which is memorised, not that which is written:**

> [!quote] 'Abd al-Razzaaq[[Al-San'aani]] said:
> 
> كُلُّ عِلْمٍ لَا يَدْخُلُ مَعَ صَاحِبِهِ الْحَمَّامَ فَلَا تَعُدَّهُ عِلْمًا
> 
> Every knowledge that does not go with its companion into the bathroom, do not count it as knowledge
> 
> {{ Al-Jaamiʿ li Akhlaaq ar-Raawi wa Aadaab as-Saamiʿ (2/250) }}

(referring to what is memorised, as one would not take their books or notes to the bathroom)

> [!quote] Al-Khaleel said:
> 
> لَيْسَ بِعِلْمٍ مَا حَوَى الْقِمَطْرُ، مَا الْعِلْمُ إِلَّا مَا حَوَاهُ الصَّدْرُ.
> 
> “Knowledge is not what a satchel contains; knowledge is only what the chest contains.”
> 
> جَامِعُ بَيَانِ الْعِلْمِ وَفَضْلِهِ (١ / ٢٩٢)

And so if they considered that which is written to not be knowledge, then the person whose knowledge is stored in notes and books would not have been considered to be an 'Aalim.

**Memorising Knowledge is of More Benefit**:
[18:17](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#18:17) 

> [!quote] [[Muhammad ibn al-Qasim ibn Khallaad]] said:
> 
> مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ الْقَاسِمِ بْنِ خَلَّادٍ قَالَ:  
> 
> قِيلَ: الِاحْتِفَاظُ بِمَا فِي صَدْرِ الرَّجُلِ أَوْلَى مِنْ دَرْسِ دَفْتَرِهِ، وَحَرْفٌ تَحْفَظُهُ بِقَلْبِكَ أَنْفَعُ لَكَ مِنْ أَلْفِ حَدِيثٍ فِي دَفَاتِرِكَ.
> 
> “It was said: Preserving what is in a man’s chest is more important than revising what is in his notebook, and a single word you retain in your heart is more beneficial to you than a thousand hadiths in your notebooks.”
> 
> الْجَامِعُ لِأَخْلَاقِ الرَّاوِي وَآدَابِ السَّامِعِ (٢ / ٢٦٦)

This was not just the view of the early Muslims:

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Uthaymeen]] said
> 
> حَفِظْنَا قَلِيلًا، وَقَرَأْنَا كَثِيرًا، فَانْتَفَعْنَا بِمَا حَفِظْنَا أَكْثَرَ مِنِ انْتِفَاعِنَا بِمَا قَرَأْنَا.
> 
> “We memorised little and read much, yet we benefited more from what we memorised than from what we read.”

So memorising even something small will benefit more than a lot of reading, note-taking and understanding.

# Balancing Memorisation and Understanding

In this program, the understanding will be far greater than the memorisation. 

Even for children, eventually understanding will be far greater than memorisation, even if memorisation takes priority at first.

The two go hand in hand, as in the analogy given by [[Sh. Muhammad Tim Humble]]:

> "**Memorisation is like having a ring of keys**. Each key opens up a store room of knowledge - that which you have read and understood."

## Neglecting Memorisation
[19:53](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#19:53) 

This will leave you unable to speak about or practice the religion without your books.

And if you lose your books you lose your knowledge.

> [!poem] [[Muhammad Ibn Wasi' Al-Azdi]] said:
> 
> إِذَا لَمْ تَكُنْ وَاعِيًا حَافِظًا ... فَجَمْعُكَ لِلْكُتُبِ لَا يَنْفَعُ،  
> 
> أَشَاهِدُ بَالِعِيًّا فِي مَجْلِسٍ ... وَعِلْمِي فِي الْبَيْتِ مُسْتَوْدَعٌ.
> 
> If you are not attentive and memorising, then your gathering of books does not benefit.  
> 
> I see something wrong in a gathering, while my knowledge is stored away at home.
> 
> {{ Al-Jaamiʿ li Akhlaaq ar-Raawi wa Aadaab as-Saamiʿ (2/251) }}

## Neglecting Understanding
[23:13](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#23:13) 

**The dispraise of memorising without understanding**:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Jumu'ah]] ([[62-5]]) 
> 
> مَثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ حُمِّلُوا۟ ٱلتَّوْرَىٰةَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَحْمِلُوهَا **==كَمَثَلِ ٱلْحِمَارِ يَحْمِلُ أَسْفَارًۢا ۚ==** بِئْسَ مَثَلُ ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِى ٱلْقَوْمَ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ ٥
> 
> The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on is **like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books]**. Wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of Allāh. And Allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people.

**Understanding takes precedence**.

Make an effort to understand each issue before moving on to the next. 

But do not get stuck: there will always be issues that you will come across that you will not understand at that time. Do not waste excessive time trying to understand these: if you cannot understand then make a note and move on.

## Children vs Adults
[27:14](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#27:14) 

Children memorise well because:
- Fewer responsibilities
- Fewer worries
- Fewer sins

Additionally, adults have the issue of immediately needing to implement the knowledge

So the balance is reversed:
- **Adults** - memorise what you can, understand more
- **Children** - memorise more, understand what you can

Memorisation is like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets. While memorisation is less for adults, do not use this as an excuse to cripple yourself. It may seem hard at the beginning, but the more you do, the more the ability develops, and the more you will be able to do.

# Practical Points on Memorisation

## Types of Memorisation
[30:38](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#30:38) 

- **Word for word memorisation**
	- Quran
	- Hadith
	- Mutoon
	- Poetry
- **Partial memorisation**
	- Larger works eg Tafsir Ibn Kathir
	- Longer statements of the scholars

## Essential Factors for Memorisation
[37:24](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#37:24) 

This will be discussed in detail in Hifdh with AMAU.

1. Discipline
2. Method of memorisation
3. Place of memorisation
4. Amount that is memorised in a sitting
5. Revision (short term memory to long term memory)

## The Two Variables in Memorisation

There are two major variables that can be adjusted in memorisation:

1. The amount you memorise in one sitting
2. The amount you repeat it in the sitting.

Aim to start with the first as small as possible, and the second as large as possible. 

Then gradually increase the amount that you memorise, and reduce the amount that you repeat.

> [!Quote] [[Ibn Abi Haatim Al Warraq]] asked [[Imam al Bukhari]]
> 
> هَلْ مِنْ دوَاءٍ يشربُهُ الرَّجُلُ، فينتفعُ بِهِ لِلْحفظِ؟فَقَالَ: لاَ أَعْلَمُ، ثُمَّ أَقبلَ عليَّ، وَقَالَ: لاَ أَعْلَمُ شَيْئاً أَنْفَعَ لِلْحفظِ مِنْ نَهْمَةِ الرَّجُلِ، وَمُدَاومَةِ النَّظَرِ
> 
> He asked Imam al Bukhari: Is there a medicine that someone can take to benefit their memorisation?
> 
> Bukhari responded "I do not know of anything more beneficial for memorisation than a man's desire/craving (eagerness), and constantly looking (at the thing to be memorised)"
> 
> سير أعلام النبلاء 12/406

## Total Memorisation Requirements
[31:41](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578981&permalink=25-memorisation-understanding#31:41) 

**'Ilm with AMAU**

Only a small amount of Hadith and texts are required to be memorised in 'Ilm with AMAU. This is in preparation for later stages where more memorisation is needed:

**Long term (Mutoon):**

In general, in the long term, should aim to memorise ~1000 lines of poetry in each major science (a little longer than Surah [[Al-Baqarah]])

Doing this for 5-7 subjects is approximately the equivalent to memorising half of the Quran.

**Long term (Hadith):**

~1500 Hadith. Approximately the equivalent of 0.5 - 1 times the Quran.

**So in total, in the long term, this is like memorising the Quran 2-3 times.** 

This is not an impossible task. And this would be a big achievement that will open up keys to knowledge many many times more than that.
