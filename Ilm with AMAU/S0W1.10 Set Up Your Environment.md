The environment should be set up to increase productivity by making focus easier and distraction harder.

# Digital Environment

For example:
- Do not install an app unless you really need it. Regularly delete things that are not needed.
- Set homepage to a blank page
- Use an Ad-blocker
- Set up an image blocker
- Only have work-critical tabs, or use work-spaces or similar
- Use full screen mode to get rid of visual clutter
- Use separate profiles whenever possible
- Log out of social media
- Use focus tools - eg phone gray-scale
- Turn notifications off
- Do not use every app just because it is available, choose work-apps purposefully
- Choose a motivating background/theme

# Physical Workspace

For example:
- Make work obvious
	- Leave your notebook open on your desk
	- Leave the next lecture open in the browser
- Only keep one project open
- Remove micro-distractions (anything on the desk that is not relevant to the task)
- Leave your phone out of reach
- Noise-cancelling headphones
- Anchor habits to locations - one place for one purpose
	- Desk is for work
	- Bed is for sleep
	- Sofa is for sitting with family

# Time based environment design

For example
- Schedule focus blocks on calendar, that are treated like meetings.
- Start at the same time daily - eliminate decision fatigue
- Have a strict end-time also
- Have start and finish routine
	- eg to start: I get my coffee, I sit down at my desk, I open my book and laptop
	- eg to finish: I open my notebook to a fresh page, I get tomorrows video ready, I clear my desk 
- Visual clues and prompts
	- sticky notes
	- productivity/habit streaks within view -(AMAU: 🗹🗹🗹🗹🗹🗹🗹)
- Limit yourself
	- eg next steps rather than tasks, as per GTD
	- 1-3 important tasks for the day

# Social environment

For example:
- Work with others
- Work in the library or co-working space, where everyone is busy
- Tell other people when you are in a focus-time so that they do not interrupt
- Do not answer calls during focused work
- Avoid unmotivated people - a lack of motivation is contagious
