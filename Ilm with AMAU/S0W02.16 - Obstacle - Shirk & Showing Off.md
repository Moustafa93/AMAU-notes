This is one of the greatest obstacles to seeking knowledge.

# Fearing Shirk

Guiding principle - **shirk is something you should truly fear**. This is not about what other people do, but we are safe

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abu Sa'eed al Khudri]]:
>  قَالَ خَرَجَ عَلَيْنَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ وَنَحْنُ نَتَذَاكَرُ الْمَسِيحَ الدَّجَّالَ
>   فَقَالَ ‏"‏ أَلاَ أُخْبِرُكُمْ بِمَا هُوَ أَخْوَفُ عَلَيْكُمْ عِنْدِي مِنَ الْمَسِيحِ الدَّجَّالِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
>    قَالَ قُلْنَا بَلَى ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ الشِّرْكُ الْخَفِيُّ أَنْ يَقُومَ الرَّجُلُ يُصَلِّي فَيُزَيِّنُ صَلاَتَهُ لِمَا يَرَى مِنْ نَظَرِ رَجُلٍ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to us when we were discussing Dajjal (False Christ) and said:
> 
> ‘Shall I not tell you of that which I fear more for you than Dajjal?’
> 
>  We said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Hidden polytheism, when a man stands to pray and makes it look good because he sees a man looking at him.’”
>  
>  { Sunan Ibn Majah 4204 }

Benefits:
- The Prophet ﷺ feared Shirk for the companions (so what of us?)
- Shirk can be hidden:

The first step in overcoming the obstacle is to be scared of it.

**The next step is to ask Allah to save you from it**:

> [!Quran] [[Ibrahim]] ([[14-35]]) 
> 
> وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَٰهِيمُ رَبِّ ٱجْعَلْ هَـٰذَا ٱلْبَلَدَ ءَامِنًۭا وَٱجْنُبْنِى وَبَنِىَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ ٱلْأَصْنَامَ ٣٥
> 
> And [mention, O Muḥammad], when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city [i.e., Makkah] secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.

Benefits:
- Ibrahim feared it (so what of us?)
- He asked Allah to save him and his sons from it

> [!Hadith] [[Muqbil ibn Yasar]]  said that he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) with [[Abu Bakr]] 
> 
>  انْطَلَقْتُ مَعَ أَبِي بَكْرٍ الصِّدِّيقِ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، فَقَالَ‏:‏ يَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ، لَلشِّرْكُ فِيكُمْ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ،
>  
 فَقَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ‏:‏ وَهَلِ الشِّرْكُ إِلاَّ مَنْ جَعَلَ مَعَ اللهِ إِلَهًا آخَرَ‏؟‏ 
>  
>  فَقَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏:‏ وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَلشِّرْكُ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ، أَلاَ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَيْءٍ إِذَا قُلْتَهُ ذَهَبَ عَنْكَ قَلِيلُهُ وَكَثِيرُهُ‏؟‏ قَالَ‏:‏ قُلِ‏:‏ اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أُشْرِكَ بِكَ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا لا أَعْلَمُ‏.‏
> 
> He said, "O Abu Bakr, polytheism enters your people more quietly (secretly) than the movement of ants."
> 
> Abu Bakr asked, "Is there a kind of polytheism besides associating anything with Allah?" 
> 
> The Prophet (ﷺ) said," By him who has my life in his power, polytheism is more concealed than the movement of ants. Shall I not teach you something which if you say will eliminate minor or major (polytheism)?" 
> 
> He then said, "Say: O Allah! I seek refuge in you lest I associate anything with you while I know it, and I seek your forgiveness for what I do not know.’"

> [!quote] From the du'a of [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] that he used to say:
> 
> اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْ عَمَلِي كُلَّهُ صَالِحًا، وَاجْعَلْهُ لِوَجْهِكَ خَالِصًا،  
وَلَا تَجْعَلْ لِأَحَدٍ فِيهِ شَيْئًا.
> 
> O Allah, make all of my deeds righteous (or valid), and make them sincerely for Your Face, and don't give anyone a share of them (through riyaa')
> 
> رَوَاهُ أَحْمَدُ فِي الزُّهْدِ (٦١٥).

# Sincerity and Seeking Knowledge

**Seeking knowledge is an act of worship**, and the proof is:

> [!hadith] Narrated [[Abu Hurayrah]], that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> 
> مَنْ تَعَلَّمَ عِلْمًا مِمَّا يُبْتَغَى بِهِ وَجْهُ اللَّهِ لاَ يَتَعَلَّمُهُ إِلاَّ لِيُصِيبَ بِهِ عَرَضًا مِنَ الدُّنْيَا لَمْ يَجِدْ عَرْفَ الْجَنَّةِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ
> 
> "Whoever acquires knowledge by which the pleasure of Allah is sought, but he only acquires it for the purpose of worldly gain, will not smell the fragrance of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection." 
> 
> {{ Sunan Ibn Majah 252 }}

This Hadith is clearly referring to knowledge of the shar'iah, based on the wording - "عِلْمًا مِمَّا يُبْتَغَى بِهِ وَجْهُ"

> [!hadith] Narrated [[Abu Hurayrah]], that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> 
> إن أول الناس يقضى يوم القيامة عليه رجل اسُتشهد، فأتي به، فعرفه نعمته، فعرفها، قال‏:‏ فما عملت فيها‏؟‏ قال‏:‏ قاتلت فيك حتى اسُتشهدت، قال‏:‏ كذبت، ولكنك قاتلت لأن يقال‏:‏ جريء، فقد قيل، ثم أمر به، فسحب على وجهه حتى ألقي في النار‏.‏
> 
> "The first to be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who had died as a martyr. He will be brought forward. Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. Then He will ask him: 'What did you do to express gratitude for it?' The man will reply: 'I fought for Your Cause till I was martyred.' Allah will say: 'You have lied. You fought so that people might call you courageous; and they have done so.' Command will then be issued about him and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell.
> 
>  ورجل تعلم العلم وعلمه، وقرأ القرآن، فأتي به، فعرفه نعمه فعرفها‏.‏ قال فما عملت فيها‏؟‏ قال تعلمت العلم وعلمته وقرأت فيك القرآن‏.‏ قال كذبت، ولكنك تعلمت ليقال‏:‏ عالم‏.‏ وقرأت القرآن ليقال‏:‏ هو قارئ، فقد قيل‏:‏ ثم أُمر به، فسُحب على وجهه حتى ألقي في النار،
>  
> Next a man who had acquired and imparted knowledge and read the Qur'an will be brought forward, Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. Then He will ask him: 'What did you do to express gratitude for it?' The man will reply: 'I acquired knowledge and taught it, and read the Qur'an for Your sake.' Allah will say to him: 'You have lied. You acquired knowledge so that people might call you a learned (man), and you read the Qur'an so that they might call you a reciter, and they have done so.' Command will then be issued about him, and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell. 
> 
>  ورجل وسع الله عليه، وأعطاه من أصناف المال، فأتي به فعرفه نعمه، فعرفها‏.‏ قال‏:‏ فما عملت فيها ‏؟‏ قال‏:‏ ما تركت من سبيل تحب أن ينفق فيها إلا أنفقت فيها لك، قال‏:‏ كذبت، ولكنك فعلت ليقال‏:‏ جواد، فقد قيل، ثم أُمر به فسُحب على وجهه ثم ألقي في النار‏
> 
> Next a man whom Allah had made affluent and to whom Allah had given plenty of wealth, will be brought forward, Allah will remind him of the favours He had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge them. He will ask him: 'What did you do to express gratitude for it?' The man will reply: 'I did not neglect any of the ways You liked wealth to be spent liberally for Your sake'. Allah will say to him: 'You have lied. You did it so that people might call you generous, and they have done so.' Command will then be issued about him and he will be dragged on his face and thrown into Hell."
> 
> {{ Muslim 1905, as in Riyad as-Salihin 1617 }}

The scholars differed as to whether these people were guilty of lesser shirk or greater shirk (ie were they munafiqun).

It is more likely that they were guilty of lesser shirk/riyaa' - that they did it for Allah but wanted people to praise them also. Yet, look at the severity of the punishment.

## Greater vs Lesser Shirk in Seeking Knowledge

**Riyaa' of the Munafiq** (Pure Riyaa') - 
- No reason other than the Riyaa'
- No part of the intention was for Allah
- Not even a belief that Allah would reward them
- 100% a lie from beginning to end
- **This is Shirk Akbar** that takes a person out of Islam

It is not expected that a Muslim would have this type of Riyaa'

> [!hadith] Narrated [[Abu Hurayrah]], that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> 
> مَنْ تَعَلَّمَ الْعِلْمَ لِيُبَاهِيَ بِهِ الْعُلَمَاءَ وَيُمَارِيَ بِهِ السُّفَهَاءَ وَيَصْرِفَ بِهِ وُجُوهَ النَّاسِ إِلَيْهِ أَدْخَلَهُ اللَّهُ جَهَنَّمَ
> 
> Whoever seeks knowledge in order to argue with the foolish, or to show off before the scholars, or to attract people's attention, Allah will admit him to Hell
> 
> {{Ibn Majah 260 }}

**Riya of the Muslim**
- Part of the intention is for the sake of Allah
- But also seeking the praise of the people.
- **This is Shirk Asghar** that destroys the value of knowledge and the reward.


## Seeking a wordly benefit as a secondary result

Meaning that the intention is for the sake of Allah, and this is the primary goal. But a person has a secondary hope for some dunyawi benefit, that falls under this act of worship.

For example: Seeking knowledge for sake of Allah, and a means by which to earn in the dunya.

**It is permissible to have a secondary intention, but a person will get more reward if they do the action purely for Allah.**

Moreover, the secondary intention has a risk of become a persons primary intention.

> [!quran] 
> [[Al-Baqarah]]([[2-198]]) 
> 
> لَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَن تَبْتَغُوا۟ فَضْلًۭا مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ ۚ فَإِذَآ أَفَضْتُم مِّنْ عَرَفَـٰتٍۢ فَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ عِندَ ٱلْمَشْعَرِ ٱلْحَرَامِ ۖ وَٱذْكُرُوهُ كَمَا هَدَىٰكُمْ وَإِن كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلِهِۦ لَمِنَ ٱلضَّآلِّينَ ١٩٨
> 
> There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord [during ḥajj]. But when you depart from ʿArafāt, remember Allāh at al-Mashʿar al-Ḥarām. And remember Him, as He has guided you, for indeed, you were before that among those astray.

> [!quote] [[Al-Qaraafi]] said 
> 
> The general idea that you get more than one thing, for example the one who obeys Allah in going for jihad, and at the same time they hope they will get a share of the war booty, this does not harm him and it is not haraam for him by consensus, because Allah has made this war booty inside of the 'ibadah.
> 
> ... Yes, there is no prohibition on a secondary intention that reduces the reward, and it would be better if the 'ibadah was pure without secondary intention.

# How to deal with Showing off

## Actions Should be Private by Deffault

Keep as much of your actions private, as much as possible.

For some actions, we cannot avoid others seeing - the public 'ibadaat such praying in the masjid or Hajj. But here the person must not publicise beyond that which is inevitable. 

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] reported that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had said:
> 
> سَبْعَةٌ يُظِلُّهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظِلِّهِ يَوْمَ لاَ ظِلَّ إِلاَّ ظِلُّهُ الإِمَامُ الْعَادِلُ وَشَابٌّ نَشَأَ بِعِبَادَةِ اللَّهِ وَرَجُلٌ قَلْبُهُ مُعَلَّقٌ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ وَرَجُلاَنِ تَحَابَّا فِي اللَّهِ اجْتَمَعَا عَلَيْهِ وَتَفَرَّقَا عَلَيْهِ وَرَجُلٌ دَعَتْهُ امْرَأَةٌ ذَاتُ مَنْصِبٍ وَجَمَالٍ فَقَالَ إِنِّي أَخَافُ اللَّهَ ‏.‏ ==وَرَجُلٌ تَصَدَّقَ بِصَدَقَةٍ فَأَخْفَاهَا حَتَّى لاَ تَعْلَمَ يَمِينُهُ مَا تُنْفِقُ شِمَالُهُ وَرَجُلٌ ذَكَرَ اللَّهَ خَالِيًا فَفَاضَتْ عَيْنَاهُ==
> 
> Seven are (the persons) whom Allah would give protection with His Shade on the Day when there would be no shade but that of Him (i. e. on the Day of Judgment, and they are): a just ruler, a youth who grew up with the worship of Allah; a person whose heart is attached to the mosques; two persons who love and meet each other and depart from each other for the sake of Allah; a man whom a beautiful woman of high rank seduces (for illicit relation), but he (rejects this offer by saying):" I fear Allah" ; **a person who gives charity and conceals it (to such an extent) that the right hand does not know what the left has given: and a person who remembered Allah in privacy and his eyes shed tears.**
> 
> {{  Sahih Muslim 1031a }}

**Sometimes there is value in doing thing in public**:

> [!Hadith] [[Jarir ibn Abdillah]] reported
> 
> كُنَّا عِنْدَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي صَدْرِ النَّهَارِ قَالَ فَجَاءَهُ قَوْمٌ حُفَاةٌ عُرَاةٌ مُجْتَابِي النِّمَارِ أَوِ الْعَبَاءِ مُتَقَلِّدِي السُّيُوفِ عَامَّتُهُمْ مِنْ مُضَرَ بَلْ كُلُّهُمْ مِنْ مُضَرَ فَتَمَعَّرَ وَجْهُ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم لِمَا رَأَى بِهِمْ مِنَ الْفَاقَةِ
> 
> While we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) in the early hours of the morning, some people came there (who) were barefooted, naked, wearing striped woollen clothes, or cloaks, with their swords hung (around their necks). Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty.
> 
> فَدَخَلَ ثُمَّ خَرَجَ فَأَمَرَ بِلاَلاً فَأَذَّنَ وَأَقَامَ فَصَلَّى ثُمَّ خَطَبَ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ ‏{‏ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ‏}‏ إِلَى آخِرِ الآيَةِ ‏{‏ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا‏}‏ وَالآيَةَ الَّتِي فِي الْحَشْرِ ‏{‏ اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلْتَنْظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ‏}
> 
> He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan). He pronounced Adhan and Iqima, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with his Companion) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur'an): '" 0 people, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single being" to the end of the verse," Allah is ever a Watcher over you" (iv. 1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr:" Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah" (lix. 18). 
> 
> ‏ تَصَدَّقَ رَجُلٌ مِنْ دِينَارِهِ مِنْ دِرْهَمِهِ مِنْ ثَوْبِهِ مِنْ صَاعِ بُرِّهِ مِنْ صَاعِ تَمْرِهِ - حَتَّى قَالَ - وَلَوْ بِشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ 
> 
> (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa' of wheat, some a sa' of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date.
> 
> ‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ فَجَاءَ رَجُلٌ مِنَ الأَنْصَارِ بِصُرَّةٍ كَادَتْ كَفُّهُ تَعْجِزُ عَنْهَا بَلْ قَدْ عَجَزَتْ - قَالَ - ثُمَّ تَتَابَعَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى رَأَيْتُ كَوْمَيْنِ مِنْ طَعَامٍ وَثِيَابٍ حَتَّى رَأَيْتُ وَجْهَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَتَهَلَّلُ كَأَنَّهُ مُذْهَبَةٌ
> 
> Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (ﷺ) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). 
> 
> فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ مَنْ سَنَّ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ سُنَّةً حَسَنَةً فَلَهُ أَجْرُهَا وَأَجْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا بَعْدَهُ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَىْءٌ وَمَنْ سَنَّ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ سُنَّةً سَيِّئَةً كَانَ عَلَيْهِ وِزْرُهَا وَوِزْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أَوْزَارِهِمْ شَىْءٌ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: **He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.**
> 
> {{  Sahih Muslim 1017a }}

**Reconciling between statements praising private and public**:

The default should be private.

In making something public, two aspects must be balanced:
- The benefit or necessity of doing that action in public
- The fear of Riyaa'

## Danger of Social Media

From the dangers of sharing on social media is Riyaa' and the evil eye.

As such:
- Anonymise where you can.
- Share the benefit not the individual.
- Only make something public when there is a strong benefit to share and a low risk of riyaa'. 

## Remove Behaviours That Are Only Done For Visibility

This will vary from person to person. Must identify the things that personally effect you (in terms of Riyaa)

**Avoid taking credit**, let the credit go to others.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Insan]] ([[76-9]]) 
> 
> إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ ٱللَّهِ لَا نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَآءًۭ وَلَا شُكُورًا ٩
> 
> [Saying], "We feed you only for the face [i.e., approval] of Allāh. We wish not from you reward or gratitude.

## Balance Public and Private Deeds

As the private deeds are the default, ensure that where a deed is occasionally done publicly, that there is a balance with that deed being done privately also.

For example: the sunnah prayers. The default is to pray them at home, but occasionally, circumstances will necessitate them to be prayed in the masjid.

Ideally one should have deeds that are private even from those at home.

## When Shaytan Tells You to Stop, Do More

> [!quote] [[Haarith ibn Qays]] said:
> 
> إِذَا أَتَاكَ الشَّيْطَانُ وَأَنْتَ تُصَلِّي فَقَالَ: إِنَّكَ تُرَائِي، فَزِدْهَا طُولًا.
> 
> If Shaytan comes to you while you are praying and says "you are showing off", then lengthen (the payer)
> 
> { الزُّهْدُ لِأَحْمَدَ بْنِ حَنْبَلٍ (١/٢٩١) }

**Recall leaving an action for others is itself Riyaa:**

> [!Quote] [[al-Fudayl ibn Iyad]] (d. 187 AH) said:
> 
> تَرْكُ العَمَلِ مِنْ أَجْلِ النَّاسِ رِيَاءٌ،  
> وَالعَمَلُ مِنْ أَجْلِ النَّاسِ شِرْكٌ،  
> وَالإِخْلَاصُ أَنْ يُعَافِيَكَ اللهُ مِنْهُمَا.
> 
> Leaving an action for the sake of the people is Riyaa' (showing off),
> and doing an action for the sake of the people is shirk,
> and ikhlaas is that Allah saves you from both of them.
