# The Ideal Method to Approach Islamic Sciences

The next 3 lessons will cover the method outlined in the aforementioned poetry in detail:

> [!poem] 
> 
> فَمَا حَوَى الْغَايَةَ فِي أَلْفِ سَنَةٍ ... شَخْصٌ فَخُذْ مِنْ كُلِّ فَنٍّ أَحْسَنَهُ،
> 
> A person could not complete the goal in a thousand years,  
> ... So take from every science the best of it,
> 
> بِحِفْظِ مَتْنٍ جَامِعٍ لِلرَّاجِحِ ... تَأْخُذُهُ عَلَىٰ مُفِيدٍ نَاصِحٍ.
> 
> by memorising a text that gathers the strongest positions,  
> ... taking it from a beneficial, sincere (teacher).
> 
> {{ Ad-Daleel ilaa al-Mutūn al-‘Ilmiyyah – Page 58 }}

This lesson will focus on:

>" فَخُذْ مِنْ كُلِّ فَنٍّ أَحْسَنَهُ | So take from every science the best of it"

i.e. outlining the sciences of Islam

# The Islamic Sciences | "كُلِّ فَنٍّ"
[1:27](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#1:27) 

In the previous student of knowledge program, there were ~40 sciences over 7 pathways, where a pathway would gather together related sciences.

Some sciences are much larger than others. Some sciences are foundational, others are optional.

So by covering all the sciences, what is meant is not necessarily studying all 40, but not leaving behind a major field within the religion of Islam.

## Obligatory vs Voluntary Knowledge
[3:27](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#3:27) 

Here we are talking about the voluntary aspect of seeking knowledge, not the obligatory knowledge that every Muslim should know, which is essentially "The basics of Islam + whatever is going on in your life right now".

## All Major Sciences Must be studied
[4:45](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#4:45) 

Islam came as a whole. The revelation was not divided into these subjects.

So to understand the Quran and Sunnah (our destination), you need all of these sciences together.

## Scholar vs Student of Knowledge
[6:19](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#6:19) 

A scholar has "**Broad depth of knowledge**".

This means depth of knowledge in all the sciences, not depth in one area only. And then, on top of this, there will be one or more sciences that they specialise in with even deeper knowledge, but this is not at the expense of the breadth.

This is why "Bachelors => Masters => PhD" is not the correct road-map, as it sacrifices broad depth for depth in one area. (this does not mean there is not a place for a Masters or PhD - but that if pursued it should be in the context of developing broad depth.)

## The Levels of Study | التَّدَرُّج 
[8:19](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#8:19) 

The way to approach studying the many subjects is:
- **Do not drop subjects**. Instead, decide the level to which you study each
- The default: "**as much as possible as high as possible**"

The levels of study could be broken down into a number of ways, including the following 5 stages:

1. **Introductory level** | المَبَادِئ / المُقَدِّمَات

The madkhal from the SOK program: general overview, definitions, benefits etc.

Could be termed "level 0" as the study of the subject itself has not really started

2. **Conclusion-based study** | التَّأصِيلb 

Covers all the issues in the sciences.

Given the conclusions without discussing the evidence or difference of opinion.

3. **Evidence-based study**| التَّدلِيل

Covers the evidences in support of the conclusions in the previous level, without comparing to evidence in support of opposing points of view

4. **Comparative study** | التَّرجِيح

Covers differences of opinion, and starts to explore why one is stronger than the other

5. **Formulating one's own opinion** | التحرير

Develops the ability to identify and defend the stronger view

**And all of these levels come before specialisation.**

It is a students personal responsibility to ensure progress through each of these levels in each of the subjects.

Note: while some books are suited for certain levels, others are more versatile, and could be taught at multiple levels. The level of the explanation could be as important as the level of the book.

### Learning Objective for AMAU
[20:05](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#20:05) 

For 'ilm with AMAU, there are approximately 1200 hours of teaching time over 5 years.

So a reasonable goal is to achieve level 3 for a broad range of subjects, with some at level 2.

The goal for itqan is to get all subjects to level 4 or 5, in preparation for study beyond - not about replacing accompanying the scholars, but allowing you to benefit from them from a strong base.

**Structure of study** ([35:11](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#35:11))

Two options:

1. Take one science at a time to a certain level, then move on to another science (i.e. spend months/years on one science at a time)
2. Multiple sciences together

Ilm with AMAU uses a combination option:

3. Study a whole topic in one science at at time. So 2-3 weeks of aqeedah, then 1-2 weeks of fiqh etc.

## Primary vs Supporting Sciences
[30:27](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#30:27) 

**Primary sciences** - studied in and of themselves

These are: 

1. Aqeedah
2. Fiqh
3. Tafseer
4. Hadith
Could also include:
5. Seerah (additional)

**Supporting sciences** - studied to be able to study the primary sciences


The primary sciences are directly connected to the Quran and Sunnah (our destination). Tafseer and Hadith are understanding the Quran and Sunnah themselves, while aqeedah and fiqh are about getting the right belief and action out of the Quran and sunnah.


# The Best of Every Science | "أَحْسَنَهُ"
[36:35](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578980&permalink=24-breaking-down-the-sciences#36:35) 

In the context of التَّدَرُّج - there is a "best" for every level.

By best, we mean we need a book that is "مَتْن جَامِع لِلرَّاجِحِ"

So it must be:

1. **A text** | مَتْن

Not a collection of notes, power point slides, excessively long book etc

2.  **Comprehensive** | جَامِع

What is comprehensive will vary from level to level, but it must cover everything needed at that level. 

3. **Widely Accepted** | مُعتَمَد

It is better to study a widely accepted book than an obscure book even if it is better. The obscure book will be difficult to find explanations, classes etc.

4. **Strongest opinions** | راجِح

The book should be correct:
- It should not be full of mistakes
- It should not be full of non-standard views
