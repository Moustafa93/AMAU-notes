# It is normal for motivation to wax and wane

Students go through ups and downs, and this is to be expected

**This is established in the Sunnah:**

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:
> 
>  ‏"‏ إِنَّ لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ شِرَّةً وَلِكُلِّ شِرَّةٍ فَتْرَةً فَإِنْ كَانَ صَاحِبُهَا سَدَّدَ وَقَارَبَ فَارْجُوهُ وَإِنْ أُشِيرَ إِلَيْهِ بِالأَصَابِعِ فَلاَ تَعُدُّوهُ ‏"
> 
> "Indeed for everything there is a zeal, and for every zeal there is a slackening. So if its practitioner behaves properly,and is moderate, then hope for him (for his success). But if the fingers are pointed to him, then do not count him (among the worthy)."  
>   
> 
> {{ Jami' at-Tirmidhi 2453 }}

*(Usdath has asked us to memorise this Hadith)*

This Hadith shows us that us that ups and downs in motivation are completely normal.

The word شِرَّة means نَشَاطٌ، شِدَّةٌ، حِرْصٌ، رَغْبَةٌ
	ie energy and motivation

So, every action has a period of high motivation, energy, keenness and desire. And then for every period of motivation, there will be a lull

**And he** ﷺ **gave us the solution in two words:** ==سَدَّدَ وَقَارَبَ==

## سَدَّدَ | Stick to the middle 

This means:
- to not go overboard until you burn out
- but to not slip below the minimum standard

**For every action, you need to set an upper bound and a lower bound, keep it within these and accept fluctuation between them.**

For example, take Qiyam al-Layl. A person could set themselves the following standards by way of example:
- minimum standard - pray just 2 rak'ah before Fajr
- maximum standard - pray a third of the night

**How to define the minimum and maximum standard?**

> [!Hadith] A similar Hadith was narrated by [[Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Aas]]:
> 
> قَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِ ﷺ: لِكُلِّ عَمَلٍ شِرَّةٌ وَلِكُلِّ شِرَّةٍ فَتْرَةٌ فَمَنْ كَانَتْ فَتْرَتُهُ إِلَى سُنَّتِي فَقَدْ أَفْلَحَ وَمَنْ كَانَتْ إِلَى غَيْرِ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ هَلَكَ
> 
> "Every action has a period of zeal, and every period of zeal is followed by a lull. Whoever's zeal aligns with my Sunnah has been rightly guided, and whoever's slackening turns to other than that has perished"
> 
> {{ Musnad Ahmad 7958 }}

So you do not go below the minumum that has been set in the Shar'iah, and you do not go beyond the maximum standard by doing what the Prophet did not encourage.

## وَقَارَبَ | Gently push oneself

A person could say, by having a minimum standard etc are you not selling yourself short?

But here, قَارَبَ is to gently push oneself to what is better

**So you do not start at maximum capacity, rather you set yourself in the middle, and gently push oneself to the top**

# Effects of sins

> [!Hadith] [[Al-Agharr al-Muzani]] reported:
عَنِ الأَغَرِّ الْمُزَنِيِّ، - وَكَانَتْ لَهُ صُحْبَةٌ - أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ 
> 
> "‏ إِنَّهُ لَيُغَانُ عَلَى قَلْبِي وَإِنِّي لأَسْتَغْفِرُ اللَّهَ فِي الْيَوْمِ مِائَةَ مَرَّةٍ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> Al-Agharr al-Muzani, who was one amongst the Companions (of the Holy Prophet) reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:
> 
> There is (at times) some sort of shade upon my heart, and I seek forgiveness from Allah a hundred times a day.
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 2702a }}

This is veil is not the sealing of the heart, but being veiled from Allah, and the heart not being its usual self.

> [!Hadith] [[Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Aas]] reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:
> إنَّ الإيمانَ لَيَخْلَقُ في جَوْفِ أحدِكُمْ كَما يَخلَقُ الثّوبُ ، فاسْألُوا اللهَ تعالَى أنْ يُجَدِّدَ الإيمانَ في قُلوبِكمْ".
> 
> Indeed, Imaan wears out inside one of you just as a garment wears out, so ask Allah to renew Imaan in your hearts.
> 
> { المعجم الكبير للطبراني (١٤٦٦٨)}
> 

Imaan is worn out by many things, such as:
- Your environment
- What you look at
- What you hear
- What you say
- The life that you lead
- The sins that you do
- The companions you keep
- The dunya and it's worldly attractions

**You should be able to feel it**. If you cannot feel the Iman wearing, or the veil coming onto the heart, there is a problem

**The cure is to seek forgiveness, and ask Allah to renew Imaans heart**.

In the wording of the Hadith, you could say:

> اللَّهُمَّ جَدِّد الإيمانَ في قَلبِي

# The importance of Idenity

The student should adopt the identity - "I am a student of knowledge". "I am not a quitter".

This is not about seniority or status, but adopting the identify of someone who has set out on the path, and acknowledging that they have dedicated themselves to the goal.

For example, you see many people say "I am an entrepreneur", though they have no business or money etc. But they adopt the entrepreneurial mindset and take on the role wholeheartedly. We should do the same with "student of knowledge".

# Remind yourself of the rewards

# Build systems that outlast motivation

This is mentioned in so many productivity books, but we have an evidence in it in the hadith of periods of motivation and lulls.

How do we get through it the lulls? Focus on a system that is not dependent on motivation.

You do not base your seeking knowledge on something that the Prophet already told us we would not have all the time.

**The greatest Hadith in productivity:**

> [!hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:
> 
>‏"‏ الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ وَفِي كُلٍّ خَيْرٌ
>
> ==احْرِصْ عَلَى مَا يَنْفَعُكَ وَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْجِزْ==
> 
>  وَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ شَىْءٌ فَلاَ تَقُلْ لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا ‏.
>
  ‏ وَلَكِنْ قُلْ قَدَرُ اللَّهِ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَانِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in everyone, (but) **be keen for that which gives you benefit (in the Hereafter) and seek help from Allah and do not lose heart**, and if anything (in the form of trouble) comes to you, don't say: If I had not done that, it would not have happened so and so, but say: Allah did that what He had ordained to do and your" if" opens the (gate) for the Satan.
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 2664 }}

*(Ustadh has asked that we memorise this Hadith, or at least the highlighted part)*

Strength here could include strengths of the body, but what is primarily meant is strengths of Imaan.

From the Hadith, we learn that in order to be productive, you must:

1. Be keen for what will benefit you, and if you believe that seeking knowledge will benefit you in the aakhirah, you will keep going
2. Ask Allah for help
3. Do not loose heart. Do not feel helpless.

**Do not start any sentence related to qadr with "if only". Instead say:**

> قَدَرُ اللَّهِ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ

Or you can say:

> قَدَّرَ اللَّهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ

But when you do that, there is a secret:

- **If you have done everything in your ability** ==> say "قَدَرُ اللَّهِ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ" and let it go
- **If there are still things that can be done** ==> say "قَدَرُ اللَّهِ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ" and go back to the beginning of the Hadith and try again.

# Leave the people who hold you back

Remember the story of [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] leaving the bad companionship of the boy from the Ansar who dissuaded him from seeking knowledge.

Likewise a person must recognise those around him who affect him who he cannot leave:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Taghabun]] ([[64-14]]) 
> 
> يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَٰجِكُمْ وَأَوْلَـٰدِكُمْ عَدُوًّۭا لَّكُمْ فَٱحْذَرُوهُمْ ۚ وَإِن تَعْفُوا۟ وَتَصْفَحُوا۟ وَتَغْفِرُوا۟ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌۭ رَّحِيمٌ ١٤
> 
> O you who have believed, indeed, among your spouses and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them. But if you pardon and overlook and forgive - then indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.

Enemies here is not meant not in the sense of a dedicated enemy. But in the sense that they are dragging you down or taking you away from the pleasure of Allah.

You cannot remove your children etc, but you have to be aware of the danger, and mitigate.
