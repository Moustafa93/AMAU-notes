# Meaning of Sidq

**Sidq** | الصِّدْقُ - *truthfulness*
	Being true to what you say.

> [!quote] [[al-Raghib al-Isfahani]]
> الصِّدْقُ مُطَابَقَةُ القَولِ الضَمِيرَ والمَخْبَرَ عَنهُ مَعاً
> 
> Truthfulness is when what you say with your tongue matches what you feel inside, and it also matches the reality your're speaking about.
> 
> {{ Mufradaat Alfaadh al-Qur'aan 1/478}}

ie what is apparent matches what is inside.

> [!Quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said regarding it
> 
> وَكَذٰلِكَ الصِّدْقُ، وَالفَرْقُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الإِخْلَاصِ أَنَّ لِلْعَبْدِ مَطْلُوبًا وَطَلَبًا.
> فَالإِخْلَاصُ تَوْحِيدُ مَطْلُوبِهِ، وَالصِّدْقُ تَوْحِيدُ طَلَبِهِ.
> فَالإِخْلَاصُ: أَنْ لَا يَكُونَ المَطْلُوبُ مُنْقَسِمًا،  
> وَالصِّدْقُ: أَنْ لَا يَكُونَ الطَّلَبُ مُنْقَسِمًا.
> فَالصِّدْقُ: بَذْلُ الجُهْدِ، وَالإِخْلَاصُ: إِفْرَادُ المَطْلُوبِ.
> 
> 
> 
> Likewise Sidq, the difference between it and ikhlas is that person has the one that they are seeking and the thing that is sought (from Him)
> 
> Sincerity is the oneness of one’s goal, while truthfulness is the oneness of that which is sought.
> 
> So sincerity is that your are not seeking from more than one, and truthfulness is that your seeking is not diverted
> 
> So truthfulness is exerting one’s full effort, and sincerity is singling out one that you seek it from.
> 
> {{ Madaarij Al-Saalikin, page 166 }}

It does not mean that you do not ask Allah for more than one thing, but that you are truly dedicated to that one thing. It is **that you are not dividing your attention**.

# Examples of Sidq

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Anas ibn Maalik]]:
> 
> قَالَ غَابَ عَمِّي أَنَسُ بْنُ النَّضْرِ عَنْ قِتَالِ بَدْرٍ فَقَالَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ، ==غِبْتُ عَنْ أَوَّلِ قِتَالٍ قَاتَلْتَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ، لَئِنِ اللَّهُ أَشْهَدَنِي قِتَالَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ لَيَرَيَنَّ اللَّهُ مَا أَصْنَعُ==، فَلَمَّا كَانَ يَوْمُ أُحُدٍ وَانْكَشَفَ الْمُسْلِمُونَ قَالَ ‏"‏ اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعْتَذِرُ إِلَيْكَ مِمَّا صَنَعَ هَؤُلاَءِ ـ يَعْنِي أَصْحَابَهُ ـ وَأَبْرَأُ إِلَيْكَ مِمَّا صَنَعَ هَؤُلاَءِ ‏"‏ ـ يَعْنِي الْمُشْرِكِينَ ـ ثُمَّ تَقَدَّمَ، فَاسْتَقْبَلَهُ سَعْدُ بْنُ مُعَاذٍ، فَقَالَ يَا سَعْدُ بْنَ مُعَاذٍ، الْجَنَّةَ، وَرَبِّ النَّضْرِ إِنِّي أَجِدُ رِيحَهَا مِنْ دُونِ أُحُدٍ‏.‏ قَالَ سَعْدٌ فَمَا اسْتَطَعْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ مَا صَنَعَ‏.‏ قَالَ أَنَسٌ فَوَجَدْنَا بِهِ بِضْعًا وَثَمَانِينَ ضَرْبَةً بِالسَّيْفِ أَوْ طَعْنَةً بِرُمْحٍ أَوْ رَمْيَةً بِسَهْمٍ، وَوَجَدْنَاهُ قَدْ قُتِلَ وَقَدْ مَثَّلَ بِهِ الْمُشْرِكُونَ، فَمَا عَرَفَهُ أَحَدٌ إِلاَّ أُخْتُهُ بِبَنَانِهِ‏.‏ قَالَ أَنَسٌ ==كُنَّا نَرَى أَوْ نَظُنُّ أَنَّ هَذِهِ الآيَةَ نَزَلَتْ فِيهِ وَفِي أَشْبَاهِهِ ‏{‏مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللَّهَ عَلَيْهِ‏}‏ إِلَى آخِرِ الآيَةِ‏.‏ ==

> My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of Badr. He said, "**O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt. Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight**." On the day of Uhud when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, "O Allah! I apologize to You for what these (i.e. his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have done." Then he advanced and Sa'd bin Mu'adh met him. He said "O Sa'd bin Mu'adh ! By the Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain of) Uhud," Later on Sa'd said, "O Allah's Apostle! I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers." **We used to think that the following Verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: "Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah.........." (33.23)**

> [!Hadith] [[Shaddad ibn Al-Haad]] narrated:
> 
> أَنَّ رَجُلاً مِنَ الأَعْرَابِ جَاءَ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَآمَنَ بِهِ وَاتَّبَعَهُ ثُمَّ قَالَ أُهَاجِرُ مَعَكَ ‏.‏ فَأَوْصَى بِهِ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم بَعْضَ أَصْحَابِهِ فَلَمَّا كَانَتْ غَزْوَةٌ غَنِمَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم سَبْيًا فَقَسَمَ وَقَسَمَ لَهُ فَأَعْطَى أَصْحَابَهُ مَا قَسَمَ لَهُ وَكَانَ يَرْعَى ظَهْرَهُمْ فَلَمَّا جَاءَ دَفَعُوهُ إِلَيْهِ فَقَالَ مَا هَذَا قَالُوا قِسْمٌ قَسَمَهُ لَكَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏.‏ فَأَخَذَهُ فَجَاءَ بِهِ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَقَالَ مَا هَذَا قَالَ ‏"‏ قَسَمْتُهُ لَكَ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ مَا عَلَى هَذَا اتَّبَعْتُكَ وَلَكِنِّي اتَّبَعْتُكَ عَلَى أَنْ أُرْمَى إِلَى هَا هُنَا - وَأَشَارَ إِلَى حَلْقِهِ بِسَهْمٍ - فَأَمُوتَ فَأَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ ==إِنْ تَصْدُقِ اللَّهَ يَصْدُقْكَ== ‏"‏ ‏.‏ فَلَبِثُوا قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ نَهَضُوا فِي قِتَالِ الْعَدُوِّ فَأُتِيَ بِهِ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يُحْمَلُ قَدْ أَصَابَهُ سَهْمٌ حَيْثُ أَشَارَ فَقَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ أَهُوَ هُوَ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ قَالُوا نَعَمْ ‏.‏ قَالَ ‏"‏ صَدَقَ اللَّهَ فَصَدَقَهُ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ ثُمَّ كَفَّنَهُ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فِي جُبَّةِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم ثُمَّ قَدَّمَهُ فَصَلَّى عَلَيْهِ فَكَانَ فِيمَا ظَهَرَ مِنْ صَلاَتِهِ ‏"‏ اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَبْدُكَ خَرَجَ مُهَاجِرًا فِي سَبِيلِكَ فَقُتِلَ شَهِيدًا أَنَا شَهِيدٌ عَلَى ذَلِكَ ‏"‏ ‏.‏

> a man from among the Bedouins came to the Prophet and believed in him and followed him, then he said: "I will emigrate with you." The Prophet told one of his Companions to look after him. During one battle the Prophet got some prisoners as spoils of war, and he distributed them, giving him (that Bedouin) a share. His Companions gave him what had been allocated to him. He had been looking after some livestock for them, and when he came they gave him his share. He said: "What is this?" They said: "A share that the Prophet has allocated to you." He took it and brought it to the Prophet and said: "What is this?" He said: "I allocated it to you." He said: "It is not for this that I followed you. Rather I followed you so that I might be shot here - and he pointed to his throat - with an arrow and die and enter Paradise." He said, "**If you are sincere toward Allah, Allah will fulfill your wish**." Shortly after that, they got up to fight the enemy, and he was brought to the Prophet, whom he had pointed to. The Prophet said, "Is it him?" They said, "Yes." He said, "He was sincere toward Allah, and Allah fulfilled his wish." Then the Prophet shrouded him in his own cloak and out him in front of him and offered the (funeral) prayer for him. During his supplication he said: "O Allah, this is Your slave who went out as a emigrant (Muhajir) for your sake and was killed as a martyr; I am a witness to that.

# Summary

Ustadh summarised the lesson in a beautiful way:

> [!Quote]
> Being sincere in wanting something is one of the meanings of al-Sidq.
> It is not enough to say that you want it, you have to truly want it.
> When the heart truly wants something, the actions will follow.
> If you are true to what you say, Allah will make it true for you.
> If you miss an opportunity, it does not mean that you will not get another chance, but you must take the chance when it comes.
> 
> Motivation should come from identity - the person believes that they are a student of knowledge, and truly want knowledge, and then they behave in a way that is true to the claim that they make.
