This lesson is a practical demonstration of the first two phases of note taking:

1. capture phase (during the lesson)
2. revising/cleaning up notes

- Notes are part of active listening, do not expect notes to be given to you.
- Notes are deeply personal. There is no absolutely write or wrong, and our notes do not have to be exactly like the demonstration.

# Capture phase

- Using a pen is better than typing. There is no harm to type up after.
- Do not write everything, do not produce a transcript
- Can use shorthand
- Can write a small part of the evidence, to find the full evidence later
- Try not to pause, could slow the video down if needed

# Cleaning up phase

During this phase, shaykh:
- Rewrote the notes in a neat and tidy format
- Highlighted principles
- Highlighted what needs memorising
- Copied and pasted full evidence
- Made a mark by a point that was not understood (marked as "* Ask")
- Re-watched the video, ensured nothing was missed, and corrected some of the notes
