# The Hadith of "إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ"

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]:
> 
> عَنْ أَمِيرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَبِي حَفْصٍ عُمَرَ بْنِ الْخَطَّابِ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ:
> 
> " إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى، فَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ إلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ فَهِجْرَتُهُ إلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ لِدُنْيَا يُصِيبُهَا أَوْ امْرَأَةٍ يَنْكِحُهَا فَهِجْرَتُهُ إلَى مَا هَاجَرَ إلَيْهِ".
> 
>  رَوَاهُ إِمَامَا الْمُحَدِّثِينَ أَبُو عَبْدِ اللهِ مُحَمَّدُ بنُ إِسْمَاعِيل بن إِبْرَاهِيم بن الْمُغِيرَة بن بَرْدِزبَه الْبُخَارِيُّ الْجُعْفِيُّ ، وَأَبُو الْحُسَيْنِ مُسْلِمٌ بنُ الْحَجَّاج بن مُسْلِم الْقُشَيْرِيُّ النَّيْسَابُورِيُّ  رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُمَا فِي "صَحِيحَيْهِمَا" اللذَينِ هُمَا أَصَحُّ الْكُتُبِ الْمُصَنَّفَةِ.
> 
> It is narrated on the authority of Amirul Mu'minin, Abu Hafs 'Umar bin al-Khattab (ra) who said:
> 
> I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: "Actions are  only by intentions, so each person will only have what he intended. so, whoever's migration (hijrah) was to Allah and His Messenger, his migration is to Allah and His Messenger; but whoever's migration was for some worldly thing he might gain, or for a women he might marry, his migration is to that for which he migrated for." 
> 
> {{ [Bukhari 1](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1) & [Muslim 1907a](http://sunnah.com/muslim/33/222), wording as per 40 Hadith an-Nawawi }} 

## The excellence of this Hadith

[[Imam al Bukhari]] began his Saheeh with this Hadith, although the chapter he placed it in is not directly related to it. **So it is as though he was saying that everything in his book should begin with the correct intention**.

> [!quote] [['Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi]] said
> 
> لَوْ صَنَّفْتُ الأَبْوَابَ لَجَعَلْتُ حَدِيثَ عُمَرَ فِي الأَعْمَالِ بِالنِّيَّةِ فِي كُلِّ بَابٍ.
> 
> "If I were to author [a book by] chapters, I would start every chapter with the Hadith of [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], that actions are by intentions."
> 
> He also said:
> 
> مَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُصَنِّفَ كِتَابًا فَلْيَبْدَأْ بِالْحَدِيثِ: «الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ».
> 
> "Whoever wants to write a book, let him start with the Hadith 'Actions are by intentions'"

> [!Quote] [[Imam Al-Shafi'i]] said
> 
> هَذَا الحَدِيثُ ثُلُثُ العِلْمِ، وَيَدْخُلُ فِي سَبْعِينَ بَابًا مِنَ الفِقْهِ.
> 
> "This Hadith is one third of all knowledge, and it enters into seventy chapters of Fiqh."
> 
> البيهقي في السُّنن الكُبرى (٣/١٤).

Here:
- "**Enters into**" - means a critical evidence
- "**Seventy chapters**" - means a vast number, rather than 70 specifically

> [!quote] [[Imam Ahmad]]:
> 
> أُصُولُ الإِسْلَامِ عَلَى ثَلَاثَةِ أَحَادِيثَ: حَدِيث عُمَرَ: «الأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ»،  
> وَحَدِيث عَائِشَةَ: «مَنْ أَحْدَثَ فِي أَمْرِنَا هَذَا مَا لَيْسَ مِنْهُ، فَهُوَ رَدٌّ»،  
> وَحَدِيث النُّعْمَانِ بْنِ بَشِيرٍ: «الْحَلَالُ بَيِّنٌ، وَالْحَرَامُ بَيِّنٌ».
> 
> The foundations of Islam are built upon three hadiths: 
> - The Hadith of [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]: "Actions are by intentions"
> - The Hadith of [['Aishah]]: "Whoever introduces into this matter of ours what is not from it, it is rejected"
> - And the Hadith of [[Al-Nu'man ibn Bashir]]: "The lawful is clear, and the unlawful is clear."
> 
> طَرْحُ التَّثْرِيب (٢/٥).

So, he is saying that **the foundations of Islam are**
1. Correct Intentions
2. Following the Sunnah
3. Keeping away from doubtful matters

# Meaning of intention | النِّيَّة

The word has two meanings:

1. Distinguishing acts of worship from each other and from customs**:

> تَمْيِيزُ العِبَادَات بَعْضِهَا عَنْ بَعْضٍ.
> 
> To distinguish the acts of worship from each other.

*For example: Dhuhr and 'Asr are both outwardly identical. They are differentiated only by intention.*

> تَمْيِيزُ العَادَةِ مِنَ العِبَادَةِ.
> 
> To distinguish habits from acts of worship.

*For example: the difference between a regular shower and ghusl*

2. **Distinguishing who is intended in the action**

> تَمْيِيزُ المَقصُودِ بِالعَمَلِ 
> 
> To distinguish what is intended by an action

Meaning:
- Is it for Allah alone?
- Or Allah and someone/something else?
- Or someone else alone?

# Explanation of the Hadith

## Core of the Hadith

The beginning of the Hadith {  إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ, وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى} is the core of the Hadith.

The word "إنَّمَا" brings the meaning of "الحَصَر"/limiting. Meaning "The only thing... "

**There is a word that is understood but not explicitly said:**

> إنَّمَا ... الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ

What is implicitly understood (in the place of ...) ?

Two main views:

- **"Take place" or "happen"** | وَاقِعَة أو حَاصِلَة
	- Sentence one  {إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ} - actions only happen because people intend something
	- Sentence two { وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى } - tells us the ruling in the shari'ah - i.e. the judgement is by intention
	  
- **"Considered" or "accepted"** | مُعتَبَرَة أو مَقبُلَة
	- Sentence one  {إنَّمَا الْأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ} - tells us the ruling in the shari'ah - i.e. the judgement is by intention
	- Sentence two { وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى } - tells us the reward is according to the intention

**By bringing the views together, we can take three key points**:

1. Actions take place because of intentions
2. Actions are judged by intentions
3. Actions are rewarded by intentions

## The importance of having the right intention

> [!Quote] [[Yahya ibn abi Kathir]] said
> 
> تَعَلَّمُوا النِّيَّةَ، فَإِنَّهَا أَبْلَغُ مِنَ العَمَلِ.
> 
> Learn intention, for it is more important than action.
> 
> أبو نُعَيْمٍ في **الحِلْيَة** (٣/٧٠).

And this is explained by the following quote:

> [!Quote] [[Mutarrif ibn Abd Allah]] said:
> 
> صَلَاحُ القَلبِ بِصَلَاحِ العَمَلِ, وصَلَاحُ العَمَلِ بِصَلَاحِ النِّيَّةِ
> 
> Righteousness of the heart depends on the righteousness of action, and righteousness of action depends on righteousness of intention.

> [!Quote] [[al-Fudayl ibn Iyad]]
> 
> In the tafseer of surah [[al-Mulk]] [[67-2]] {لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۚ}, he said:
> 
> وَقَالَ فُضَيْلُ بْنُ عِيَاضٍ: «أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا: أَخْلَصُهُ وَأَصْوَبُهُ».  
> وَقَالَ: العَمَلُ لَا يُقْبَلُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ خَالِصًا صَوَابًا؛  
> الخَالِصُ: إِذَا كَانَ لِلَّهِ،  
> وَالصَّوَابُ: إِذَا كَانَ عَلَى السُّنَّةِ.
> 
> The best deed is that which is most sincere and most correct.
> 
> A deed is not accepted until it is sincere and done the right way
> Sincere: meaning it is for Allah
> And done the right way: meaning it is in accordance with the Sunnah.
> 
> {{ Tafsir al-Baghawi }}

> [!Quran] [[Al-Kahf]] ([[18-110]]) 
> 
> قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَا۠ بَشَرٌۭ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰٓ إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَـٰهُكُمْ إِلَـٰهٌۭ وَٰحِدٌۭ ۖ فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُوا۟ لِقَآءَ رَبِّهِۦ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًۭا صَـٰلِحًۭا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِۦٓ أَحَدًۢا ١١٠
> 
> Say, "I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone."

## Example of Hijrah

The example given in the Hadith was Hijrah.

And three people were mentioned:

1. The one who made hijrah for Allah and his Messenger (ﷺ),  the  "مُهَاجِر"

It is sufficient an honour for him that he was able to do what he intended by making Hijrah.

2. Businessman | تَاجِر
3. Suitor | خَاطِب

Neither did anything wrong, but they did not get a hijrah, and are not called a muhaajir.

They got only that temporary gain in the dunya. 

The wording "مَا هَاجَرَ إلَيْهِ" is to belittle the action,  and used because there is no limit to the intentions a person could have, besides for the sake of Allah.

# Issues related to the Niyyah

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Ubayy ibn Ka'b]] that the Messenger ﷺ said:
> 
> بَشِّرْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةَ بِالسَّنَاءِ وَالرِّفْعَةِ وَالنَّصْرِ وَالتَّمْكِينِ فِي الْأَرْضِ ==فَمَنْ عَمِلَ مِنْهُمِ عَمَلَ الْآخِرَةِ لِلدُّنْيَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ نَصِيبٌ==
> 
> "Give glad tidings to this Ummah (nation) of success, elevation, victory, and establishment upon the earth. **But whoever among them performs the deeds of the Hereafter for the sake of the worldly life, he shall not have a share in the hereafter.**" 
> 
> {{ Musnad Ahmad 21222 }}


Types of riyaa'
### 1. Pure Riyaa' | الرياء المحض

This is the Riyaa' of the Munafiq

The person only wants to show off. Their only intention is the dunya, and they have no other reason for doing the action:

> [!quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4-142]]) 
> 
> إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَـٰفِقِينَ يُخَـٰدِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَهُوَ خَـٰدِعُهُمْ وَإِذَا قَامُوٓا۟ إِلَى ٱلصَّلَوٰةِ قَامُوا۟ كُسَالَىٰ يُرَآءُونَ ٱلنَّاسَ وَلَا يَذْكُرُونَ ٱللَّهَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًۭا ١٤٢
> 
> Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive Allāh, but He is deceiving them. And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, showing [themselves to] the people and not remembering Allāh except a little,

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ma'un]] ([[107-4]] to 7)
> 
> فَوَيْلٌۭ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ ٤
> 
> So woe to those who pray
> 
> ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ ٥
> 
> [But] who are heedless of their prayer -
> 
> ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَآءُونَ ٦
> 
> Those who make show [of their deeds]
> 
> وَيَمْنَعُونَ ٱلْمَاعُونَ ٧
> 
> And withhold [simple] assistance.

**They have no other reason for their action except to show off**:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Anfal]] ([[8-47]]) 
> 
> وَلَا تَكُونُوا۟ كَٱلَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا۟ مِن دِيَـٰرِهِم بَطَرًۭا وَرِئَآءَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطٌۭ ٤٧
> 
> And do not be like those who came forth from their homes insolently and to be seen by people and avert [them] from the way of Allāh. And Allāh is encompassing of what they do.

> [!Quote] [[Ibn Rajab]] said:
> 
> وَهٰذَا الرِّيَاءُ المَحْضُ لَا يَكَادُ يَصْدُرُ عَنْ مُؤْمِنٍ فِي فَرْضِ الصَّلَاةِ وَالصِّيَامِ، وَقَدْ يَصْدُرُ فِي الصَّدَقَةِ الوَاجِبَةِ وَالحَجِّ ==وَغَيْرِهِمَا مِنَ الأَعْمَالِ الظَّاهِرَةِ الَّتِي يَتَعَدَّى نَفْعُهَا، فَإِنَّ الإِخْلَاصَ فِيهَا عَزِيزٌ==. وَهٰذَا العَمَلُ لَا يَشُكُّ مُسْلِمٌ أَنَّهُ حَابِطٌ، وَأَنَّ صَاحِبَهُ يَسْتَحِقُّ المَقْتَ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَالعُقُوبَةَ.
> 
> 
> This pure form of showing off rarely occurs from a believer in the obligatory prayers and fasting. 
> 
> It may occur, however, in obligatory charity, pilgrimage, and other **actions where you seek to benefit others, for sincerity in them is rare**.
> 
> No Muslim doubts that such a deed is nullified, and that its doer deserves Allah’s hatred and punishment.

**Actions where you seek to benefit others are extremely hard to have ikhlas in.**
For example: teaching, charity

### 2. For Allah and for someone else

**The action is completely nullified**:

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as stating that Allah the Most High and Exalted said:
> 
> قَالَ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى أَنَا أَغْنَى الشُّرَكَاءِ عَنِ الشِّرْكِ مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلاً أَشْرَكَ فِيهِ مَعِي غَيْرِي تَرَكْتُهُ وَشِرْكَهُ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> I am the One, One Who does not stand in need of a partner. If anyone does anything in which he associates anyone else with Me, I shall abandon him with one whom he associates with Allah.
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 2985 }}

### 3. For Allah and for worldly benefit

**The reward decreases, but will not be removed completely**:

> [!Hadith] [[Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Aas]] reported that the Messenger ﷺ said:
> 
> إِنَّ الغُزَاةَ إِذَا غَنِمُوا غَنِيمَةً، تَعَجَّلُوا ثُلُثَيْ أُجُورِهِمْ، فَإِنْ لَمْ يَغْنَمُوا شَيْئًا، تَمَّ لَهُمْ أُجُورُهُمْ.
> 
> Indeed, those who go out to fight, if they receive war booty, this is two thirds of their reward, and if they don't receive anything, then they get the reward completely.
> 
> جَامِعُ العُلُومِ وَالحِكَمِ (١/٨٣).

This is for the one who intends for Allah and wants benefit from the dunya. This is not for the one who wants the dunya only.

They will lose from the reward with Allah based on how much of their intention was for the dunya. And they may lose no reward if their seeking the dunya was completely secondary.

# How to address Riyaa' in oneself

**If the person starts sincerely, then in the middle they feel themselves showing off**:

Difference of opinion, bit the stronger view is that their action is not null and void.

They are rewarded for their first niyah, and they loose whatever they showed off in. 

If the action is continuous/unbroken like Salah and Fasting then they should try to push away the incorrect intention. If it is not continuous, like dhikr or seeking knowledge, they should stop, renew the intention and restart.

**If praise comes to someone, and they do not intended**:

They are not culpable. And the evidence:

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Dharr]] reported:
> 
> قِيلَ لِرَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَرَأَيْتَ الرَّجُلَ يَعْمَلُ الْعَمَلَ مِنَ الْخَيْرِ وَيَحْمَدُهُ النَّاسُ عَلَيْهِ قَالَ ‏ "‏ تِلْكَ عَاجِلُ بُشْرَى الْمُؤْمِنِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> It was said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ): What is your opinion about the person who has done good deeds and the people praise him? He said: It is glad tidings for a believer (which he has received in this mortal world).
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 2642a }}

But the person must not let it go to the heart:

> [!quote] [[Imam Ahmad]] said
> 
> مَنْ عَرَفَ نَفْسَهُ لَمْ يَضُرَّهُ مَدْحُ النَّاسِ لَهُ وَلَا ذَمُّهُمْ إِيَّاه.
> 
> Whoever knows himself is not harmed by peoples praised or criticism.

# Correct Intentions for Seeking Knowledge

**To remove ignorance from oneself and others**:

> [!Quote] [[Imam Ahmad]] said
> 
> العِلْمُ لَا يَعْدِلُهُ شَيْءٌ لِمَنْ صَحَّتْ نِيَّتُهُ. فَقَالُوا: كَيْفَ تَصِحُّ النِّيَّةُ يَا أَبَا عَبْدِ اللَّهِ؟ قَالَ: يَنْوِي رَفْعَ الجَهْلِ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ وَعَنْ غَيْرِهِ.
> 
> "There is nothing like knowledge for the one whose inention is correct."
> 
> They asked: "how does one's intention become correct?"
> 
> He said "That he intends to remove ignorance from himself and from others"
> 
> فَتَاوَى نُورٍ عَلَى الدَّرْبِ لِلْعُثَيْمِينَ (٢/٨).
