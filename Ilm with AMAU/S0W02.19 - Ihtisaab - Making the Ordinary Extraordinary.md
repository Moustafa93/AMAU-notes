# Worldly Duties are Unavoidable

We spend much of our time doing worldly duties. This was even the case for the Prophet ﷺ:

> [!quran] [[Al-Muazzammil]] (73-7) 
> 
> إِنَّ لَكَ فِى ٱلنَّهَارِ سَبْحًۭا طَوِيلًۭا ٧
> 
> Indeed, for you by day is prolonged occupation.

But this time, and these actions that we are doing anyway, can be leveraged through intention.

# The levels of Zuhd

> [!quote] [[Imam Ahmad]] said regarding Zuhd:
> 
> الزُّهْدُ عَلَى ثَلَاثَةِ أَوْجُهٍ:  
> الأول: تَرْكُ الحَرَامِ، وَهُوَ زُهْدُ العَوَامِّ.  
> وَالثَّانِي: تَرْكُ الفُضُولِ مِنَ الحَلَالِ، وَهُوَ زُهْدُ الخَوَاصِّ.  
> وَالثَّالِثُ: تَرْكُ مَا يَشْغَلُ عَنِ اللَّهِ، وَهُوَ زُهْدُ العَارِفِينَ.
> 
> Zuhd has three forms:  
> - Firstly: abstaining from what is unlawful, which is the asceticism of the common people;  
> - Secondly: abstaining from excess in what is lawful, which is the asceticism of the select;  
> - Thirdly: abstaining from whatever distracts from Allah, which is the asceticism of those who truly know Him.”
> 
> كتاب مدارج السالكين ([2:223](https://shamela.ws/book/199/745))

[[Sh. Muhammad Tim Humble]] mentioned four levels, splitting the first above level into two:

1. **Leaving Haram**

This is what everyone must do. And in the context of worldly duties, it means to at the very least ensure that they are not falling into the Haram
	
2. **Leaving doubtful matters**

This is "الوَرَعُ":
> Avoiding doubtful matters out of fear of falling into Haram

> [!hadith] [[Al-Nu'man ibn Bashir]] narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:
> 
> إِنَّ الْحَلاَلَ بَيِّنٌ وَإِنَّ الْحَرَامَ بَيِّنٌ وَبَيْنَهُمَا مُشْتَبِهَاتٌ لاَ يَعْلَمُهُنَّ كَثِيرٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ فَمَنِ اتَّقَى الشُّبُهَاتِ اسْتَبْرَأَ لِدِينِهِ وَعِرْضِهِ وَمَنْ وَقَعَ فِي الشُّبُهَاتِ وَقَعَ فِي الْحَرَامِ كَالرَّاعِي يَرْعَى حَوْلَ الْحِمَى يُوشِكُ أَنْ يَرْتَعَ فِيهِ
> 
> What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are the things doubtful which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in doubtful things indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it.
> 
> { Sahih Muslim 1599a }

3. **Leaving what is extra and not needed** 

Meaning not wasting time with things, even if they are Halal.

4. **Leaving everything that doesn't benefit in the Aakhirah** 

This is the highest level, and this is what is the true/full meaning of Zuhd.

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said:
> 
> وَالْفَرْقُ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ الْوَرَعِ:
> أَنَّ الزُّهْدَ تَرْكُ مَا لَا يَنْفَعُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ، 
> وَالْوَرَعُ تَرْكُ مَا يُخْشَى ضَرَرُهُ فِي الْآخِرَةِ.
> 
> “The difference between it (zuhd) and waraʿ is:
> - zuhd is leaving what does not benefit in the Hereafter
> - waraʿ is leaving what one fears might cause harm in the Hereafter.”
> 
> Al-Fawaa'id li ibn al-Qayyim (1/118)

# Ihtisaab & Reward for Worldly Duties

> [!definition] Ihtisaab | الاحتساب
> *Having a sincere intention while seeking reward from Allah*

For example:

> [!hadith] Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:
> 
مَنْ صَامَ رَمَضَانَ إِيمَانًا ==وَاحْتِسَابًا== غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ وَمَنْ قَامَ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ
> 
> He who observed the fasts of Ramadan with faith and **seeking reward** (from Allah), all his previous sins would be forgiven, and he who observed prayer on Lailat-ul- Qadr with faith and seeking reward (from Allah), all his previous sins would be forgiven.
> 
> { Sahih Muslim 760a }

> [!hadith] Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:
> 
> مَنْ قَامَ رَمَضَانَ إِيمَانًا ==وَاحْتِسَابًا== غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ
> 
> He who observed prayer at night during Ramadan, because of faith and **seeking his reward** from Allah, his previous sins would be forgiven.
> 
> { Sahih Muslim 759a }

> [!quote] [[Imam al-Nawawi]] explains this Hadith:
> أَنْ يُرِيدَ اللَّهَ تَعَالَى وَحْدَهُ، لَا يَقْصِدُ رُؤْيَةَ النَّاسِ وَلَا غَيْرَ ذٰلِكَ مِمَّا يُخَالِفُ الإِخْلَاصَ.
> 
> That a person intends Allah, the Most High, alone, and does not seek the people’s gaze, nor anything else that contradicts sincerity.
> 
> شَرْحُ النَّوَوِيِّ عَلَى مُسْلِمٍ (٦/٣٩)

> [!quote] Al-Haafidh [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] explains the Hadith:
> 
> الأَجْرُ المَوْعُودُ بِهِ إِنَّمَا يَحْصُلُ لِمَنْ صَنَعَ ذٰلِكَ احْتِسَابًا، أَيْ خَالِصًا.
> 
> “The promised reward is only attained by the one who does that with iḥtisāb, meaning: purely (for Allah alone).”
> 
> فتح الباري شرح صحيح البخاري لابن حجر العسقلاني  (1/110)

## Ihtisaab in matters of the Dunya

**It is possible to have ihtisaab in matter of dunya**:

> [!quote] [[Mu'adh ibn Jabal]] said to [[Abu Musa al-Ash'ari]]:
> 
>  أَمَّا أَنَا فَأَنَامُ وَأَقُومُ، فَأَحْتَسِبُ نَوْمَتِي كَمَا أَحْتَسِبُ قَوْمَتِي
> 
> "As for me, I sleep and I stand (in prayer), and I seek reward for my sleep just as I seek reward for my standing."
> 
> { Sahih al-Bukhari 4344, 4345 }

**Ihtisaab in matters of the dunya requires an intention related to 'ibaadah**

i.e. the action is a means to 'ibadah.

For example:
- Sleeping in order to wake up for qiyam
- Working in order to fulfill the rights of ones family

The action is not an act of worship in and of itself, but the intention can either change it into an act of worship, or achieve reward as a means to an act of worship.

**Ihtisaab requires the heart to be present** 

(As do all matters regarding intention).

## Awareness of the heart

The opposite is describe in the Hadith:

> [!Hadith] Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:
> 
> ادْعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَنْتُمْ مُوقِنُونَ بِالإِجَابَةِ وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَسْتَجِيبُ دُعَاءً ==مِنْ قَلْبٍ غَافِلٍ لاَهٍ==
> 
> “Call upon Allah while being certain of being answered, and know that Allah does not respond to a supplication from the heart of **one heedless and occupied by play**.”
> 
> {{ Jami' at-Tirmidhi 3479 }}

> [!quote] [[al-Ghazzaali]] said:
> 
> "Presence of the heart is for it to be empty of anything else that it is involved in. Therefor, when a person is able to leave thinking about other than what they are doing, and their heart remembers consciously what they are doing, and they are not in a state of heedlessness, then this is when they have presence of the heart."

**So to achieve presence of the heart, you must:**
- **Empty the heart** of everything besides what you are doing
- **Fill the heart** with focus in what you are doing

> [!quran] [[Qaf]] ([[50-37]]) 
> 
> إِنَّ فِى ذَٰلِكَ لَذِكْرَىٰ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُۥ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى ٱلسَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌۭ ٣٧
> 
> Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present [in mind].

> [!quote] [[Imam al-Sa'di]] explained this ayah:
> 
> { إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَذِكْرَى لِمَنْ كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ } أي: قلب عظيم حي، ذكي، زكي، فهذا إذا ورد عليه شيء من آيات الله، تذكر بها، وانتفع، فارتفع وكذلك من ألقى سمعه إلى آيات الله، واستمعها، استماعًا يسترشد به، وقلبه { شَهِيدٌ } أي: حاضر، فهذا له أيضا ذكرى وموعظة، وشفاء وهدى.
> 
> Meaning: a great heart - alive, intelligent, and pure. When something from the verses of Allah reaches such a heart, it remembers through them, it benefits and is elevated. Likewise is the one who gives his ear to the verses of Allah and listens to them with the intention of seeking guidance, while his heart is "present". Such a person also recives a reminder, admonintion, healing and guidance.
> 
> {{  Tafsir Sa'di, ([[50-37]])}}

Presence of the heart is particularly important to work on for worldly deeds, because they tend to be automatic/robotic by default.
