A personal student planner should record 2 things:
- The Roadmap (What you will study, in sha Allah)
- The Progress (What you have studied)

It is not specific to AMAU, but should encompass all the study that you do, inclusive of that which is studied after AMAU.

There is no absolute correct way to do it, it can be adjusted & developed over time.

# The Roadmap

## Core of the Roadmap

**Where to start?** [01:35](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#01:35) 

Start with the syllabus for 'ilm with AMAU and Student of Knowledge. When the itqan syllabus is released, this too can be included.

**How to organise?**

The road-map could be divided into subjects 

May be better to combine the subjects into pathways [04:21](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#04:21) : 
- Can use the same pathways as per the SOK program
- Should separate Arabic as a formal subject from learning to speak Arabic

Divide the road-map into levels [07:25](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#07:25):
- Could use beginner, intermediate, advanced
- Could use the 5 levels discussed earlier this week
- The introductory level could be based on notes, but anything beyond this must be based on books

**Include Everything** [09:07](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#09:07)

Everything that you are studying should be together, consolidated into one road-map, and not recorded separately: 
- Make sure you include whatever you are studying now.
- If you use itqan as the blueprint, ensure that you include 'ilm with AMAU books also
- If you are doing anything outside AMAU, include this also

But also, make sure to do not include books that you do not need.

## Memorisation Program
[10:58](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#10:58) 

Can use the 'ilm with AMAU memorisation plan and the SOK memorisation plan as blueprints.

This may be less at the beginning, but must ensure that the roadmap includes memorisation

Could divide this into easy and difficult memorisation options.

Unless you know that you will be able to memorise the difficult options, it may be better to progress through a small, medium and large text. This will include some repetition, but may be easier to build up to. It also helps in having the small text to teach later.

## Side Subjects and Recommended Readings
[15:17](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#15:17) 

These are books and classes that are not the core of the road-map, but beneficial to include along side to support the core study.

They will often be paired to a particular part of the core road-map 

This could include works to do alongside the core book, or simple introductions to do before the core book. 

## Reading Plan
[18:26](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#18:26) 

This is separate to recommended reading on the side of the road map.

This is a separate, core part of the road-map, that is followed in and of itself, rather than alongside something else.

# The Student Record Page
[19:14](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579926&permalink=30-personal-student-planner#19:14) 

**What should be recorded?**

Certain information must be recorded for every class that is studied, for example:
- The teacher
- The book
- The author
- Type of study- Was it in person, live online, prerecorded, or simply reading an explanation? 
- Was the class taught based on a particular explanation? This could become recommended reading.
- If applicable: grades and ijazaat.
- Reflections and next steps (eg if you feel you need to study that book again)

**The Record Pages can help you plan next steps**

Having this record page allows you to see gaps and identify what needs doing. This could include identifying a book that you studied online that you would like to study in person.

The record pages can also be shown to a specialist teacher, so that they can review your progress and identify any gaps.

**Studying out of order**

Different books on your roadmap will be taught at different times, and so you may not be able to follow the order on the road-map perfectly.

It is ok to study something early if needed based on availability if:
- It is not too far above your current level
- You ensure that you go back and study the parts that should have come before
