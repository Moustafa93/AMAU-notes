This lesson, and the following lesson, looks at intention from the angle of opportunity rather than worry.

# How The Salaf Dealt With Intention

> [!quote] [[Sufyan al-Thawri]] Said
> 
> كَانُوا يَتَعَلَّمُونَ النِّيَّةَ لِلْعَمَلِ كَمَا تَتَعَلَّمُونَ العَمَلَ.
> 
> They used to learn how to make intention for an action just as you learn how to perform the action itself

> إِحْيَاءُ عُلُومِ الدِّينِ – أَبُو حَامِدٍ الغَزَالِيُّ (٤/٣٦٤).

Intention is not a wording - verbalising the intention typically is an innovation and not allowed, and this is not what is meant here.

Rather they learned the intricacies of intention:
- The right and wrong ways of making intention
- Intending to do something good
- Intending to leave something bad
- Stacking multiple intentions within a single action

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said
> 
> إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَتَبَ الْحَسَنَاتِ وَالسَّيِّئَاتِ، ثُمَّ بَيَّنَ ذَلِكَ فَمَنْ هَمَّ بِحَسَنَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا كَتَبَهَا اللَّهُ لَهُ عِنْدَهُ حَسَنَةً كَامِلَةً، فَإِنْ هُوَ هَمَّ بِهَا فَعَمِلَهَا كَتَبَهَا اللَّهُ لَهُ عِنْدَهُ عَشْرَ حَسَنَاتٍ إِلَى سَبْعِمِائَةِ ضِعْفٍ إِلَى أَضْعَافٍ كَثِيرَةٍ، وَمَنْ هَمَّ بِسَيِّئَةٍ فَلَمْ يَعْمَلْهَا كَتَبَهَا اللَّهُ لَهُ عِنْدَهُ حَسَنَةً كَامِلَةً، فَإِنْ هُوَ هَمَّ بِهَا فَعَمِلَهَا كَتَبَهَا اللَّهُ لَهُ سَيِّئَةً وَاحِدَةً
> 
> "Allah has decreed the good and the bad deeds, then He then that clear. If somebody intends to do a good deed and he does not do it, then Allah will write for him a full good deed; and if he intends to do a good deed and actually did it, then Allah will write for him with Him (its reward equal) from ten to seven hundred times to many more times: and if somebody intended to do a bad deed and he does not do it, then Allah will write a full good deed (in his account) with Him, and if he intended to do it (a bad deed) and actually did it, then Allah will write one bad deed (in his account) ."
> 
> {Sahih al-Bukhari 6491}

| Intention & Action                         | Reward                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Intend good & don't follow through         | One reward             |
| Intend good & follow through               | 10-700 rewards or more |
| Intend Haraam and (conciously) don't do it | One Reward             |
| Intend Haraam & follow through             | One sin                |

Note the Hadith deals with number but not degree. "One sin" of zina is not the same of one sin of breaking a promise.

> [!quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] ([[2-261]]) 
> 
> مَّثَلُ ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُمْ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ كَمَثَلِ حَبَّةٍ أَنۢبَتَتْ سَبْعَ سَنَابِلَ فِى كُلِّ سُنۢبُلَةٍۢ مِّا۟ئَةُ حَبَّةٍۢ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ يُضَـٰعِفُ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ وَٰسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ ٢٦١
> 
> The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allāh is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allāh multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allāh is all-Encompassing and Knowing.

# Five Situations of Leaving Sins

1. **Leaving the sin for Allah**

The person is rewarded.

For example:
- Fear of Allah
- Shyness before Allah
- Fear of punishment
- Seeking reward with Allah

2. **Leave out of Riyaa'**

The person has no reward, and instead has sinned.

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said:
> 
> وَالثَّانِي: كَمَنْ يَتْرُكُهَا لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ لَا لِلَّهِ، فَهٰذَا يُعَاقَبُ عَلَى تَرْكِهِ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ، كَمَا يُعَاقَبُ عَلَى فِعْلِهِ لِغَيْرِ اللَّهِ.
> 
> The second is like the one who abandons it not for the sake of Allah, but for other than Allah. Such a person is punished for abandoning it for other than Allah, just as he is punished for doing it for  other than Allah
> 
> شِفَاءُ العَلِيلِ فِي مَسَائِلِ القَضَاءِ وَالقَدَرِ وَالحِكْمَةِ وَالتَّعْلِيلِ لِابْنِ القَيِّمِ ([170](https://shamela.ws/book/12021/189)).

Included in this is the people who don't do the sin in front off people, but when alone they do it.

3. **Leaving the sin due to inability**

Meaning the person is keen to commit the sin, but is unable to do so for whatever reason.

The person is punished as if they committed the sin.

> [!quote] Narrated [[Abu Bakr]]:
> 
> فَإِنِّي سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‏"‏ إِذَا الْتَقَى الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَالْقَاتِلُ وَالْمَقْتُولُ فِي النَّارِ ‏"‏‏.‏
> 
 قُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ هَذَا الْقَاتِلُ فَمَا بَالُ الْمَقْتُولِ
>  
>  قَالَ ‏"‏ ==إِنَّهُ كَانَ حَرِيصًا عَلَى قَتْلِ صَاحِبِهِ== ‏"‏‏.‏
> 
> I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying,'If two Muslims meet each other with their swords then (both) the killer and the killed one are in the (Hell) Fire.' I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is alright for the killer, but what about the killed one?' He said, 'The killed one was eager to kill his opponent."
> 
> { Sahih al-Bukhari 6875 }

4. **Leaving it out of shyness in front of the people**

The person is not punished, and might be rewarded

But to be rewarded for this, there has to be an intention that goes back to Allah. For example: "Allah loves a person to be shy. Allah loves a person to conceal their sins. "

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said:
> 
> فَالفَرْقُ بَيْنَ تَرْكٍ يَتَقَرَّبُ بِهِ إِلَيْهِمْ وَمُرَاءَاتِهِمْ بِهِ،  
> وَتَرْكٍ يَكُونُ مَصْدَرُهُ الحَيَاءُ مِنْهُمْ وَخَوْفُ أَذَاهُمْ لَهُ وَسُقُوطِهِ مِنْ أَعْيُنِهِمْ؛  
> فَهٰذَا لَا يُعَاقَبُ عَلَيْهِ، بَلْ قَدْ يُثَابُ عَلَيْهِ إِذَا كَانَ لَهُ فِيهِ غَرَضٌ يُحِبُّهُ اللَّهُ،  
> مِنْ حِفْظِ مَقَامِ الدَّعْوَةِ إِلَى اللَّهِ، وَقَبُولِهِمْ مِنْهُ، وَنَحْوِ ذٰلِكَ.
> 
> “So the difference is between abandoning something as a means of drawing closer to people and showing off to them through it, and abandoning something whose source is modesty before them, fear of their harm, or fear of loosing ones standing in their eyes.  
> The latter is not punishable; rather, one may even be rewarded for it if it serves a purpose beloved to Allah, such as preserving the standing of calling to Allah, maintaining their acceptance, and the like.”
> 
> شِفَاءُ العَلِيلِ فِي مَسَائِلِ القَضَاءِ وَالقَدَرِ وَالحِكْمَةِ وَالتَّعْلِيلِ لِابْنِ القَيِّمِ ([170](https://shamela.ws/book/12021/189)).

5. **Leaving the sin because you no longer want to do it**

The person is not rewarded and not punished.

# The Reward for Truthful Intentions

> [!hadith]  [[Sahl ibn Hunayf]] reported the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:
> 
> مَنْ سَأَلَ اللَّهَ الشَّهَادَةَ ==صَادِقًا== بَلَّغَهُ اللَّهُ مَنَازِلَ الشُّهَدَاءِ وَإِنْ مَاتَ عَلَى فِرَاشِهِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> If anyone asks Allah for martyrdom **truthfully**, Allah will make him reach the ranks of martyrs even if he died on his bed.
> 
> Sunan Abi Dawud 1520

If a person has a truthful intention, and works towards something, but doesn't get it, then they will have the reward for it.

But the key word is truthfully - the person has to make the effort.

# Multiplying Virtues by Layering Intentions

> [!quote] [[al-Ghazzaali]] Said:
> 
> أَمَّا الأَصْلُ فَهُوَ أَنْ يَنْوِيَ بِهَا عِبَادَةَ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى لَا غَيْرَ، فَإِنْ نَوَى الرِّيَاءَ صَارَتْ مَعْصِيَةً، وَأَمَّا تَضَاعُفُ الفَضْلِ فَبِكَثْرَةِ النِّيَّاتِ الحَسَنَةِ.
> 
> As for the foundation, is it that one intends by it the worship of Allah, the Most High, alone. If one intends to show off, it becomes a sin. As for the multiplication of virtue, it is through the abundance of good intentions
> 
> إِنَّ الطَّاعَةَ الوَاحِدَةَ يُمْكِنُ أَنْ يُنْوَى بِهَا خَيْرَاتٌ كَثِيرَةٌ، فَيَكُونُ لَهُ بِكُلِّ نِيَّةٍ ثَوَابٌ، إِذْ كُلُّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْهَا حَسَنَةٌ، ثُمَّ تُضَاعَفُ كُلُّ حَسَنَةٍ عَشْرَ أَمْثَالِهَا، كَمَا وَرَدَ بِهِ الخَبَرُ.
> 
> A single act of obedience can carry many good intentions, and for each intention there is a reward, since each of them is a good deed. Then every good deed is multiplied tenfold, as mentioned in the narration.
> 
> إِحْيَاءُ عُلُومِ الدِّينِ – أَبُو حَامِدٍ الغَزَالِيُّ (٤/٣٧٠).
