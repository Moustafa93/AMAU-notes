# The problem

Many students of knowledge start strong, and then struggle to continue

This is because there are structural obstacles that they cannot overcome.

**Semester 0 addresses this by building the correct habits, systems and consistency to be successful.**

This is to build a strong foundation before starting the books and subjects. 

# Where to Find Solutions

The solutions to modern problems are found in the Quran and the Sunnah

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nahl]] ([[16-89]]) 
> 
> وَيَوْمَ نَبْعَثُ فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍۢ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْهِم مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَجِئْنَا بِكَ شَهِيدًا عَلَىٰ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ ۚ ==وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ تِبْيَـٰنًۭا لِّكُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ== وَهُدًۭى وَرَحْمَةًۭ وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ ٨٩
> 
> And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves [i.e., their prophet]. And We will bring you, [O Muḥammad], as a witness over these [i.e., your nation]. **And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things** and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims.

Benefit:
- The Quran contains all the knowledge we need, but people often fall short in extracting it.

> [!poem] [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] said in a line of poetry:
> 
> جَمِيعُ العِلمِ فِي القُرْآنِ لَكِنْ ... تَقَاصَرَ عَنهُ أَفهَامُ الرِّجَالِ
> 
> All knowledge is contained in the Quran but... the understanding of people falls short in grasping it.
> 
> {{ Jam' al-wasā'il fī sharḥ al-shamā'il 35/2 }}

> [!hadith] [[Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn 'Aas]] narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:
> 
> ‏ "‏إِنَّهُ لَمْ يَكُنْ نَبِيٌّ قَبْلِي إِلاَّ كَانَ حَقًّا عَلَيْهِ أَنْ يَدُلَّ أُمَّتَهُ عَلَى مَا يَعْلَمُهُ خَيْرًا لَهُمْ وَيُنْذِرَهُمْ مَا يَعْلَمُهُ شَرًّا لَهُمْ ==وَإِنَّ أُمَّتَكُمْ هَذِهِ جُعِلَتْ عَافِيَتُهَا فِي أَوَّلِهَا== ... ‏"‏ ‏‏
> 
> There has a never been a prophet before me who was not obliged to tell his nation of what he knew was good for them, and to warn against that he knew was bad for them. With regard to Ummah of yours, ==safety has been placed in its earlier generations==...
> 
> {{ Sunan an-Nasa'i 4191 }}

Benefits:
- Every prophet was obliged to guide to the best and warn against what is harmful, so the Prophet ﷺ had to have taught us the solutions to our problems 
- The safety of this Ummah lies in it's early generations, so progress is found by returning to their way

# The Structure of Semester 0

## Semester 0 is built around 3 core principles:

1. **Relevance**

	Addresses real obstacles, based on prior student feedback

2. **Tradition with adaptation** 

	The challenges are modern, but solutions are not. Answers are from Quran, Sunnah and early Muslims
	
3. **Action Based Learning**

	Activities and homework is given to solidify the learning

Eventually the content of this semester will be made into an "AMAU handbook".
## Weekly plan for Semester 0

Each semester is 12 weeks, with each week having a defined study goal

The topics for each week of semester 0 are:

1. Maximum Motivation
2. Battling Sincerity
3. The Correct Method
4. Developing a Culture of Hard Work
5. Repentance and Remembrance
6. Consistency
7. Effective Time Management
8. The Best of Manners
9. Connection to the Scholars
10. Attachment to Books
11. Overcoming Obstacles
12. Applying Knowledge

**Each week of Semester 0 follows the same structure:**

- Define the goal
- Explain why it matters
- Explore the Quran, Sunnah and what the early Muslims were upon in relation to the topic
- Identify the obstacles & give the practical tools to overcome them

**Then in the final week**, applying knowledge, a classical text on seeking knowledge will be taught.

# Approach to Notes and Memorisation

The lessons will contain **four types of information**, which should be approached in the following ways: 

1. **Word for word memorisation** 

	- The primary evidence for each key point
		- If lots of evidence is given, memorise the most important one (the one that is mentioned first, or the one with the most detail in it)
		- If an evidence is long, memorise the "shaahid" (intended point of the evidence)
 
	- Definitions and principles
		- If they are given formally in Arabic
		- It is rare to need memorise anything word for word in English - as we will need to re-memorise in Arabic later anyway.
		
2. **Partial memorisation**

	- Important points from the lesson
	- Benefits from the quotes (in some detail, for example "the three benefits were...")
	- Translations of the quotes
	
3. **Conceptual understanding**

	- Can be recorded in the notes
	- Can be summarised and reworded.Can summarise for notes
	- No memorisation is required - just requires looking over the notes briefly

4. **Filler content**

	- Should not be written down or memorised
