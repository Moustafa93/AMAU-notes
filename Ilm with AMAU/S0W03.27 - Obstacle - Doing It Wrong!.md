# The Obstacle of Doing Things Wrong

Doing things the wrong way is one of the greatest obstacles in seeking knowledge.

> [!Hadith] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] narrated:
> 
> خَطَّ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ خَطًّا بِيَدِهِ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: «هَذَا سَبِيلُ اللَّهِ مُسْتَقِيمًا»، وَخَطَّ خُطُوطًا عَنْ يَمِينِهِ وَشِمَالِهِ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: «هَذِهِ السُّبُلُ، لَيْسَ مِنْهَا سَبِيلٌ إِلَّا عَلَيْهِ شَيْطَانٌ يَدْعُو إِلَيْهِ»، ثُمَّ قَرَأَ: ﴿ وَأَنَّ هَذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكم عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ﴾.
> 
> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ drew a line with his hand and said, “This is the straight path of Allah.” Then he drew lines to its right and left and said, “These are the paths. There is no path among them except that upon it is a devil calling to it.” Then he recited: “And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way.” (Quran 6:153)
> 
> مُسْنَدُ الإِمَامِ أَحْمَدَ (4142)

This applies to seeking knowledge, not just to being an upright Muslim:

> [!Quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said
> 
> يَنْحَصِرُ شَرُّ الشَّيْطَانِ فِي سِتَّةِ أَجْنَاسٍ، لَا يَزَالُ بِابْنِ آدَمَ حَتَّىٰ يَنَالَ مِنْهُ وَاحِدًا مِنْهَا أَوْ أَكْثَرَ.
> 
> The evil of Shayṭān is confined to six categories. He does not cease with the son of Ādam until he attains from him one of them or more.
> 
> { Badaa’iʿ al-Fawaa’id ([Vol. 2, pg. 260–261](https://shamela.ws/book/12003/481))}

And the six ways the Shaytan calls a person are:

1. Kufr and shirk
2. Bid'ah
3. Major sins
4. Lesser sins
5. Becoming busy with permissible things instead of good things
6. Becoming busy with something less virtuous with something that is more virtuous

The Shaytan is subtle in the ways that he calls you.

# How Shaytan Tricks Students of Knowledge
[4:59](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579330&permalink=27-obstacle-doing-it-wrong#4:59) 

So in the aforementioned Hadith, it is not that every path is disbelief. Rather, some paths have goodness, but are not the goodness that is required. Included in this is seeking knowledge in the wrong way.

It is not impossible, but for the shayateen to call a student of knowledge to Kufr is not easy. So they start with the lesser categories first. 

From the ways the Shaytan diverts a student of knowledge in method:

[7:24](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579330&permalink=27-obstacle-doing-it-wrong#7:24) 

- **Impatience** (opposing tadarruj)

> [!quran] [[Al-Isra]] ([[17-11]]) 
> 
> وَيَدْعُ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ بِٱلشَّرِّ دُعَآءَهُۥ بِٱلْخَيْرِ ۖ ==وَكَانَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ عَجُولًۭا== ١١
> 
> And man supplicates for evil [when angry] as he supplicates for good, and **man is ever hasty**.

- **Helplessness**

> [!hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:
> 
>‏"‏ الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ وَفِي كُلٍّ خَيْرٌ
>
> ==احْرِصْ عَلَى مَا يَنْفَعُكَ وَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْجِزْ==
> 
>  وَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ شَىْءٌ فَلاَ تَقُلْ لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا ‏.
>
  ‏ وَلَكِنْ قُلْ قَدَرُ اللَّهِ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَانِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in everyone, (but) **be keen for that which gives you benefit (in the Hereafter) and seek help from Allah and do not lose heart**, and if anything (in the form of trouble) comes to you, don't say: If I had not done that, it would not have happened so and so, but say: Allah did that what He had ordained to do and your" if" opens the (gate) for the Satan.
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 2664 }}

- **Lying to yourself / hiding your own flaws**

- **Comparing yourself with others**

- **Repeating the same mistake, expecting a different outcome**

## Practical Traps in Seeking Knowledge
[11:59](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4579330&permalink=27-obstacle-doing-it-wrong#11:59) 

- **Not aiming for the Quran and Sunnah**

	This leads to:
	- Blind following
	- Exaggeration with regard to one's sheikh
	- Bid'a
	- Not getting the knowledge that you want

> [!quote]  [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] said:
> 
> وَبِهَذَا يَتَبَيَّنُ أَنَّ أَحَقَّ النَّاسِ بِأَنْ تَكُونَ هِيَ الْفِرْقَةُ النَّاجِيَةُ أَهْلُ الْحَدِيثِ وَالسُّنَّةِ؛  
> الَّذِينَ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ مَتْبُوعٌ يَتَعَصَّبُونَ لَهُ إِلَّا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ،  
> وَهُمْ أَعْلَمُ النَّاسِ بِأَقْوَالِهِ وَأَحْوَالِهِ، وَأَعْظَمُهُمْ تَمْيِيزًا بَيْنَ صَحِيحِهَا وَسَقِيمِهَا،  
> وَأَئِمَّتُهُمْ فُقَهَاءُ فِيهَا، وَأَهْلُ مَعْرِفَةٍ بِمَعَانِيهَا، وَاتِّبَاعًا لَهَا: تَصْدِيقًا وَعَمَلًا وَحُبًّا،  
> وَمُوَالَاةً لِمَنْ وَالَاهَا، وَمُعَادَاةً لِمَنْ عَادَاهَا.
> 
> الَّذِينَ يَرُدُّونَ الْمَقَالَاتِ الْمُجْمَلَةَ إِلَىٰ مَا جَاءَ بِهِ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ؛  
> فَلَا يُنَصِّبُونَ مَقَالَةً وَيَجْعَلُونَهَا مِنْ أُصُولِ دِينِهِمْ وَجُمَلِ كَلَامِهِمْ إِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ ثَابِتَةً فِيمَا جَاءَ بِهِ الرَّسُولُ،  
> بَلْ يَجْعَلُونَ مَا بُعِثَ بِهِ الرَّسُولُ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ هُوَ الْأَصْلَ الَّذِي يَعْتَقِدُونَهُ وَيَعْتَمِدُونَهُ.

> By this it becomes clear that the people most deserving of being the saved sect are the People of Hadith and Sunnah: those who have no one they blindly follow except the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. They are the most knowledgeable of people regarding what he said and how he used to be, and the most capable of distinguishing between what is authentic and what is unsound from them. Their Imams are the fuqaha in it, people of insight into its meanings, and of true adherence to it—through belief, action, and love—showing loyalty to those loyal to it and enmity to those hostile to it.
> 
> They refer ambiguous statements back to what he brought of the Book and the Wisdom. They do not establish a statement and make it from the foundations of their religion and the core of their discourse unless it is established in what the Messenger ﷺ brought. Rather, they make what the Messenger was sent with—of the Book and the Wisdom—the foundational principle which they believe in and rely upon.

- **Not returning to the understanding of Salaf** 
 
Including holding views that people before them did not hold

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Umayyah Al Jumahi]] narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said
> 
مِن أشراطِ السَّاعةِ أن يُلتَمَسَ العِلمُ عِندَ الأصاغِرِ 
>
>"From the signs of the hour is that knowledge will be sought from those who are junior"

>  { Ibn Mubarak - Al-Zuhd,  61 }

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] (d 32 AH) said:
> 
>  لا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا أَتَاهُمُ الْعِلْمُ مِنْ قِبَلِ أَصْحَابِ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَأَكَابِرِهِمْ فَإِذَا أَتَاهُمُ الْعِلْمُ مِنْ قِبَلِ أَصَاغِرِهِمْ فَذَلِكَ حِينَ هَلَكُوا
> 
> People will not cease to be upon good, as long as their knowledge comes to them from the Companions of the Prophet (SAW) and their seniors. When their knowledge comes from their juniors, this is when they will be destroyed.
 >
 { al-Tabarani }

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mubarak]] was asked: "who are the juniors?" He said:
> 
> الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ بِرَأْيِهِمْ، فَأَمَّا صَغِيرٌ يَرْوِي عَنْ كَبِيرٍ فَلَيْسَ بِصَغِيرٍ
> 
> They are those are those who speaks from their own oppinions. As for a junior person who narrates from a senior person, this person is not a junior (ie not what is meant by the Hadith)
> 
> { Ibn Mubarak - Al-Zuhd,  1/21 }

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mubarak]] said:
> 
> الْأَصَاغِرُ أَهْلُ الْبِدَعِ
> 
> The Juniors are the people of innovation

- **Not aiming to take a broad range of sciences**

It is ok to specialise in something, but this requires a broad deep base to specialise from

- **Diluting knowledge**

eg constantly consuming content not part of the road-map. Studying randomly.

Doesn't mean that you cannot attend any other lecture or watch any other content - but it must not be at the expense of the road-map.

- **Neglecting key texts and relying on notes**

Notes are useful but a person should be attached to the text, and should aim to master the text

Notes should be consolidated onto the text, rather than scattered.

- **Focusing on the wrong texts**

ie texts that are not comprehensive, correct, or well known

- **Not studying with progression**

Both of the book and the explanation must be at the right level.

- **Not studying with those who are qualified**

- **Not having tarbiyyah and guidance**

Either because the teacher is not willing to give it, or because you are not taking it from them.

- **No connection with the Scholars**

- **Not planning or recording progress**

- **Being satisfied with texts as the end goal**

They are the beginning of the journey.
