This lesson is about practical ways to be aware of ones intention and the situations, scenarios and emotions that affect ones intention and dangers to sincerity.

# When Should We Question Our Intentions?
[01:41](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#01:41) 

In general, we should question our intention before, during and after the action.

**Before the action**:

Why am I doing this?

Both in the negative (ensure no insincerity) and positive (maximise intention, intention stacking etc)

**During the action**:

Continue asking "Am I doing this for Allah?"

In some scenarios the "during" stage is more of a problem than others (such as actions in public, or where you are benefiting others)

**After the action**:

"Was I true to my intention?"

Reflect on the action and the intention. Were there any vulnerabilities in the intention?

A journal or notebook can be helpful to reflect on and analyse situations that you want to learn from. 

# Building Sincerity Into a Daily Routine

**Ensure that this dua is memorised**:

> [!quote] Du'a
> 
>   اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أُشْرِكَ بِكَ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا لا أَعْلَمُ‏
>   
>  O Allah! I seek refuge in you lest I associate anything with you while I know it, and I seek your forgiveness for what I do not know.

**When Thinking About Doing Haram** [36:47](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#36:47) 

Turn it into a good intention by intending to leave it.

**Have hidden deeds**:

> [!quote] [[Zubayr ibn al-'Awwaam]] said:
> 
> مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمْ أَنْ يَكُونَ لَهُ خَبْءٌ مِنْ عَمَلٍ صَالِحٍ فَلْيَفْعَلْ.
> 
> Whoever among you is able to have a hidden righteous deed let him do it.
> 
> { المُصَنَّفُ لِابْنِ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ (٧/١٣٣).}

There are two types of hidden good deeds:

- **Truly Hidden** - Absolutely no one knows about them except Allah (even those in your household.)

- **Partially Hidden** - Known in a partial or anonymised way. For example, a recipient of charity given anonymously.

Try get as many of either type, but especially truly hidden.

**A persons greatest hope for ikhlas is to have something truly hidden from everything**. Though this itself has it's own dangers in self-amazement.

# Dangers to Sincerity

## The Danger Behind Truly Hidden Good Deeds
[08:50](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#08:50) 

**The danger is feeling impressed about your own good deeds.**

### The Remedy to Self Amazement

In order to "pull the rug out from under the feet", reflect on the following whenever afflicted with self amazement:

**The people Allah praises are the ones who do things fearing it will not be accepted.**

> [!quran] [[Al-Mu'minun]] ([[23-60]]) 
> 
> وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَآ ءَاتَوا۟ وَّقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ أَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ رَٰجِعُونَ ٦٠
> 
> And they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their Lord -

> [!Hadith] [['Aishah]] asked the Prophet ﷺ about this ayah:
> 
> قُلْتُ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ‏{وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَا آتَوْا وَقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ}‏ أَهُوَ الرَّجُلُ الَّذِي يَزْنِي وَيَسْرِقُ وَيَشْرَبُ الْخَمْرَ قَالَ ‏"‏ لاَ يَا بِنْتَ أَبِي بَكْرٍ - أَوْ يَا بِنْتَ الصِّدِّيقِ - ==وَلَكِنَّهُ الرَّجُلُ يَصُومُ وَيَتَصَدَّقُ وَيُصَلِّي وَهُوَ يَخَافُ أَنْ لاَ يُتَقَبَّلَ مِنْهُ== ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> “I said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, ‘And those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear.” [[23-60]] Is this the one who commits adultery, steals and drinks alcohol?’ He said: ‘No, O daughter of Abu Bakr’ – O daughter of Siddiq – rather **it is a man who fasts and gives charity and prays, but he fears that those will not be accepted from him**.’”
> 
> {{ Sunan Ibn Majah 4198 }}

**The Sahabah were worried that not even a single sajdah was accepted**:

> [!quote] A beggar came to [[Ibn 'Umar]], who told his son to give the beggar a dinar. His son said "May Allah accept from you my father". [[Ibn 'Umar]] said:
> 
> 
> لَوْ عَلِمْتُ أَنَّ اللَّهَ تَقَبَّلَ مِنِّي سَجْدَةً وَاحِدَةً أَوْ صَدَقَةَ دِرْهَمٍ، لَمْ يَكُنْ غَائِبٌ أَحَبَّ إِلَيَّ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ. أَتَدْرِي مِمَّنْ يَتَقَبَّلُ اللَّهُ؟ { إِنَّمَا يَتَقَبَّلُ اللَّهُ مِنَ الْمُتَّقِينَ }
> 
> 
> If I knew that Allah had accepted from me even a single prostration or the charity of one dirham, there would be nothing absent more beloved to me than death (i.e. I would wish to die at that moment). Do you know from whom Allah accepts? Indeed, "Allah only accepts from the people of taqwā" (Quran [[5-27]]).
> 
> ابن عساكر (31/146)

**The Sahaba feared despite giving the maximum action:**

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said:
> 
> مَنْ تَأَمَّلَ أَحْوَالَ الصَّحَابَةِ - رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ - وَجَدَهُمْ فِي غَايَةِ الْعَمَلِ مَعَ غَايَةِ الْخَوْفِ، وَنَحْنُ جَمِيعًا بَيْنَ التَّقْصِيرِ، بَلِ التَّفْرِيطِ وَالْأَمْنِ،
> 
> Whoever thinks about the situation of the Sahaba finds that they were giving maximum effort with maximum fear. And we have joined between falling short, rather negligence, and believing ourselves to be safe.
> 
> الداء والدواء ([ص 40](https://shamela.ws/book/158/34))

> [!quote] [[Ibn Abi Mulaykah]] said:
> 
> أَدْرَكْتُ ثَلَاثِينَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ ٱلنَّبِيِّ ﷺ، كُلُّهُمْ يَخَافُ ٱلنِّفَاقَ عَلَىٰ نَفْسِهِ، مَا مِنْهُمْ أَحَدٌ يَقُولُ: إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ إِيمَانِ جِبْرِيلَ.
> 
> I met thirty of the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ; all of them feared hypocrisy for themselves. Not one of them would say, ‘I am upon the faith of Jibreel.’
> 
> مُعَلَّقَاتُ ٱلْبُخَارِيِّ قَبْلَ ٱلْحَدِيثِ رَقْمَ (٣٥)

**What you do will never be good enough:**

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said:
> 
> وَكُلَّمَا شَهِدْتَ حَقِيقَةَ الرُّبُوبِيَّةِ وَحَقِيقَةَ الْعُبُودِيَّةِ، وَعَرَفْتَ اللَّهَ، وَعَرَفْتَ النَّفْسَ، وَتَبَيَّنَ لَكَ أَنَّ مَا مَعَكَ مِنَ الْبِضَاعَةِ لَا يَصْلُحُ لِلْمَلِكِ الْحَقِّ، وَلَوْ جِئْتَ بِعَمَلِ الثَّقَلَيْنِ خَشِيتَ عَاقِبَتَهُ وَإِنَّمَا يَقْبَلُهُ بِكَرَمِهِ وَجُودِهِ وَتَفَضُّلِهِ، وَيُثِيبُكَ عَلَيْهِ أَيْضًا بِكَرَمِهِ وَجُودِهِ وَتَفَضُّلِهِ.
> 
> Every time that you witness the reality of Allah's Lordship and the reality of your servitude (to Him), you know Allah and you know yourself, and it becomes clear to you that **what you have brought Allah is not good enough for Al-Malik Al-Haqq**.
> 
> Even if you had brought the actions of all the men and the Jinn, you would fear the result. **Allah only accepts because of His generosity, kindness and grace. And He only rewards you because of His generosity, kindness and grace**.
> 
> مدارج السالكين ([1/194](https://shamela.ws/book/8370/168))

This is the quote that must be read whenever this issue comes up.

Every good deed you have ever done, be certain it was not good enough for Allah.

Rather you should say what the brothers of Yusuf ﵇ said:

> [!quran] [[Yusuf]] ([[12-88]]) 
> 
> فَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا۟ عَلَيْهِ قَالُوا۟ يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْعَزِيزُ مَسَّنَا وَأَهْلَنَا ٱلضُّرُّ وَجِئْنَا بِبِضَـٰعَةٍۢ مُّزْجَىٰةٍۢ فَأَوْفِ لَنَا ٱلْكَيْلَ وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَآ ۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجْزِى ٱلْمُتَصَدِّقِينَ ٨٨
> 
> So when they entered upon him [i.e., Joseph], they said, "O ʿAzeez, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have come with goods poor in quality, but give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allāh rewards the charitable."

And our state in front of Allah is worse than their state in front of Yusuf ﵇. 

## The Danger Behind Private Deeds
[16:57](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#16:57) 

The dangers include: 

- Riyaa' from people close to you (eg members of the family)

- Exposing ones deeds to others

- Making others think you did better than you did:

> [!quote] As said by one of the narrators of a Hadith:
> 
> قَالَ الرَّاوِي:  
> كُنْتُ عِنْدَ سَعِيدِ بْنِ جُبَيْرٍ فَقَالَ لَنَا: أَيُّكُمْ رَأَى الْكَوْكَبَ الَّذِي انْقَضَّ الْبَارِحَةَ؟ قَالَ: قُلْتُ: أَنَا. أَمَا إِنِّي لَمْ أَكُنْ فِي الصَّلَاةِ، وَلَكِنِّي لُدِغْتُ.
> 
> The narrator said: “I was with Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr when he said to us, ‘Which of you saw the shooting star that fell last night?’ I said, ‘I did.’ I then said, ‘I was not praying at the time, rather I had been stung.’”
> 
> صَحِيحُ ابْنِ حِبَّانَ (٦٤٣٠)

**What to do if people  find out about private deeds**?

The first is to stop them from finding out. If they find out, the deed must be played down. 

Our feelings on them finding out must also be questioned: "did we want them to know?"

Likewise, we must compare private deeds to public deeds, and ensure that the public deeds are not better.

**What to do if it is necessary to share a private deed?**

If you have to tell someone about a private deed, then try to anonymise if possible, and/or try to play it down.

**What to do if you are praised for something?**

Make the following Du'a, which should be learned:

> [!quote] Du'a:
> 
> اللَّهُمَّ لَا تُؤَاخِذْنِي بِمَا يَقُولُونَ، وَاغْفِرْ لِي مَا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ، وَاجْعَلْنِي خَيْرًا مِمَّا يَظُنُّونَ.
> 
> O Allah, do not take me to account for what they say about me, forgive me for what they do not know, and make me better than what they think of me.
> 
> شُعَبُ الْإِيمَانِ لِلْبَيْهَقِيِّ (٤٨٧٦)

**What to do about the feeling to tell someone about what you did?**

Repel it.

But what about the ayah:

> [!quran] [[Al-Duha]] ([[93-11]]) 
> 
> وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ ١١
> 
> But as for the favor of your Lord, report [it].

Some people make a mistake and take this ayah more generally than it should be taken, (that they should share all the good things they have done and everything they have achieved etc)

Rather the ayah either came generally: praising Allah for the blessings that He gave you. Or specifically: for the blessing of Islam itself.

So the ayah is not justification for sharing ones good deeds.

## The Danger of Wanting Recognition
[22:46](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#22:46)  

For example, thinking "after all I did, you aren't even going to thank me?"

> [!quran] [[Al-Insan]] ([[76-9]]) 
> 
> إِنَّمَا نُطْعِمُكُمْ لِوَجْهِ ٱللَّهِ لَا نُرِيدُ مِنكُمْ جَزَآءًۭ وَلَا شُكُورًا ٩
> 
> [Saying], "We feed you only for the face [i.e., approval] of Allāh. We wish not from you reward or gratitude.

In any case, recognition from people always disappoints. They don't have what you want, and they don't give what you deserve.

**If you want goodness from the people, be sincere to Allah:**

> [!quote] [[Abu Hurayrah]] reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said:
> 
> إِنَّ اللَّهَ إِذَا أَحَبَّ عَبْدًا دَعَا جِبْرِيلَ فَقَالَ إِنِّي أُحِبُّ فُلاَنًا فَأَحِبَّهُ - قَالَ - فَيُحِبُّهُ جِبْرِيلُ ثُمَّ يُنَادِي فِي السَّمَاءِ فَيَقُولُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ فُلاَنًا فَأَحِبُّوهُ ‏.‏ فَيُحِبُّهُ أَهْلُ السَّمَاءِ - قَالَ - ثُمَّ يُوضَعُ لَهُ الْقَبُولُ فِي الأَرْضِ ‏.‏ وَإِذَا أَبْغَضَ عَبْدًا دَعَا جِبْرِيلَ فَيَقُولُ إِنِّي أُبْغِضُ فُلاَنًا فَأَبْغِضْهُ - قَالَ - فَيُبْغِضُهُ جِبْرِيلُ ثُمَّ يُنَادِي فِي أَهْلِ السَّمَاءِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُبْغِضُ فُلاَنًا فَأَبْغِضُوهُ - قَالَ - فَيُبْغِضُونَهُ ثُمَّ تُوضَعُ لَهُ الْبَغْضَاءُ فِي الأَرْضِ ‏"‏
> 
> When Allah loves a servant, He calls Gabriel and says: Verily, I so and so; you should also love him, and then Gabriel begins to love him. Then he makes an announcement in the heaven saying: Allah loves so and so and you also love him, and then the inhabitants of the Heaven (the Angels) also begin to love him and then there is conferred honour upon him in the earth; and when Allah is angry with any servant He calls Gabriel and says: I am angry with such and such and you also become angry with him, and then Gabriel also becomes angry and then makes an announcement amongst the inhabitants of heaven: Verily Allah is angry with so-and so, so you also become angry with him, and thus they also become angry with him. Then he becomes the object of wrath on the earth also.

> كَانَ الْعُلَمَاءُ فِيمَا مَضَى يَكْتُبُ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَىٰ بَعْضٍ بِهَؤُلَاءِ الْكَلِمَاتِ:

## The Danger Behind Public Deeds
[26:09](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#26:09) 

A person must compare their public deeds to private deeds. Do not let the public be better than the private.

**But the solution is not to leave the public deed** - leaving a deed for the people is Riyaa'

While doing an action in public, you can imagine yourself in an empty room. How would you do that action? See if you feel something different. If you do - do not stop the action, but fight the intention.

**And the deeds that benefit others, such as teaching or charity, requires constantly fighting over the intention more so than other deeds.**

> [!quote] [[Sulaimaan al-Haashimi]] said:
> 
> رُبَّمَا أُحَدِّثُ بِحَدِيثٍ وَلِي نِيَّةٌ، فَإِذَا أَثْنَيْتُ عَلَى بَعْضِهِ، تَغَيَّرَتْ نِيَّتِي، فَإِذَا الحَدِيثُ الوَاحِدُ يَحْتَاجُ إِلَى نِيَّاتٍ.

## The Danger of Influential People
[30:33](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#30:33) 

In reference to a person of power or wealth etc.

Do not be with such a person in the hope that they will give you something from the dunya. In particular when it comes to actions that should be for ALlah - e.g. teaching a rich person hoping that they will give you money.

If you are with such a person, take the approach that you will go to give and not to take.

Related to this is the problem of giving a gift hoping for return.

## The Danger of Feeling Oppressed
[33:13](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#33:13) 

> [!quran]  [[al-Nur]] ([[24-22]]) 
> 
> وَلَا يَأْتَلِ أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْفَضْلِ مِنكُمْ وَٱلسَّعَةِ أَن يُؤْتُوٓا۟ أُو۟لِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ وَٱلْمَسَـٰكِينَ وَٱلْمُهَـٰجِرِينَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ۖ
> 
>   ==وَلْيَعْفُوا۟ وَلْيَصْفَحُوٓا۟ ۗ أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَن يَغْفِرَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌۭ رَّحِيمٌ ٢٢==
> 
> And let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give [aid] to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants for the cause of Allāh, and let them pardon and overlook. Would you not like that Allāh should forgive you? And Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful.

**Context of this Ayah**: When [[Abu Bakr]] was oppressed by one of his relatives who he used to help financially. This relative spread the rumour regarding Umm al-Mu'mineen [['Aishah]]. [[Abu Bakr]] took an oath to no longer help this man, and Allah revealed this ayah. So [[Abu Bakr]] said "I certainly want Allah to forgive me", and took an oath that we will never stop supporting that man even though he oppressed him.

**The feeling of oppression can cause you to lose sincerity.** 

It can make you act not for the sake of Allah, but because you feel the need to hit back or want to harm the other party.

You may even do something that should be an act of worship (eg defending the Sunnah), but insincerely, with the intention of defending your reputation.

## The Danger of Fearing Loss or Facing Harm
[35:14](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#35:14) 

For example: avoiding forbidding evil due to consequences for yourself. And so you act to please the people and not Allah.

> [!quran] [[Aal 'Imran]] ([[3-187]]) 
> 
> وَإِذْ أَخَذَ ٱللَّهُ مِيثَـٰقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُۥ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُۥ فَنَبَذُوهُ وَرَآءَ ظُهُورِهِمْ وَٱشْتَرَوْا۟ بِهِۦ ثَمَنًۭا قَلِيلًۭا ۖ فَبِئْسَ مَا يَشْتَرُونَ ١٨٧
> 
> And [mention, O Muḥammad], when Allāh took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], "You must make it clear [i.e., explain it] to the people and not conceal it." But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price. And wretched is that which they purchased.

Note: This doesn't oppose Hikmah in what is said, but it opposes the idea of concealing knowledge for personal gain or to avoid personal loss.

# A Question that Students of Knowledge Must Ask
[37:04](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/battling-sincerity-week-2?cid=4570345&permalink=20-questioning-your-sincerity#37:04) 

Is this knowledge that is sought knowledge for the sake of being knowledgeable? Or is it knowledge for the sake of action?

> [!hadith]  [[Ka'b ibn Maalik]] narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying:
> 
> مَنْ طَلَبَ الْعِلْمَ لِيُجَارِيَ بِهِ الْعُلَمَاءَ أَوْ لِيُمَارِيَ بِهِ السُّفَهَاءَ أَوْ يَصْرِفَ بِهِ وُجُوهَ النَّاسِ إِلَيْهِ أَدْخَلَهُ اللَّهُ النَّارَ
> 
> Whoever seeks knowledge to contend with the scholars, or to use it to argue with the fools, and to have people's faces turn towards him, then he shall be admitted to the Fire
> 
> { Jami' at-Tirmidhi 2654 }

Knowledge is meant to be acted on, and the intention should be to seek knowledge to act upon it.
