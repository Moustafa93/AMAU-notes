**This topic is summarised in the following Hadith:**

> [!Hadith] [[Ka'b ibn Maalik]] narrated that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said:
> 
> مَا ذِئْبَانِ جَائِعَانِ أُرْسِلاَ فِي غَنَمٍ بِأَفْسَدَ لَهَا مِنْ حِرْصِ الْمَرْءِ عَلَى الْمَالِ وَالشَّرَفِ لِدِينِهِ
> 
> { Jami' at-Tirmidhi 2376 }

This Hadith is one of the most important evidences on this topic and should be memorised

# Fame and Fortune

**Human beings are attracted to fame and fortune by nature:**

> [!quran] [[Aal 'Imran]] ([[3-14]]) 
> 
> زُيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ حُبُّ ٱلشَّهَوَٰتِ مِنَ ٱلنِّسَآءِ وَٱلْبَنِينَ وَٱلْقَنَـٰطِيرِ ٱلْمُقَنطَرَةِ مِنَ ٱلذَّهَبِ وَٱلْفِضَّةِ وَٱلْخَيْلِ ٱلْمُسَوَّمَةِ وَٱلْأَنْعَـٰمِ وَٱلْحَرْثِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ مَتَـٰعُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ۖ وَٱللَّهُ عِندَهُۥ حُسْنُ ٱلْمَـَٔابِ ١٤
> 
> Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire - of women and sons, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded horses, and cattle and tilled land. That is the enjoyment of worldly life, but Allāh has with Him the best return [i.e., Paradise].

> [!quran] [[Al-Shu'ara]] ([[26-41]] to [[26-52]])  
> 
> فَلَمَّا جَآءَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ قَالُوا۟ لِفِرْعَوْنَ أَئِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرًا إِن كُنَّا نَحْنُ ٱلْغَـٰلِبِينَ ٤١
> 
> And when the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, "Is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant?"
> 
> قَالَ نَعَمْ وَإِنَّكُمْ إِذًۭا لَّمِنَ ٱلْمُقَرَّبِينَ ٤٢
> 
> He said, "Yes, and indeed, you will then be of those near [to me]."

Pharaoh offered the magicians money and power, as these are human motivations.

# Dangers of the digital World

Social media has resulted in a number of phenomena:
- It has increased the exposure of a person to the world
- It has made fame and fortune feasible for more be to obtain, even without intention (eg accidentally going viral)
- It has meant that personal identity can become a commodity.

This results in a number of dangers.

## Dangers to Sincerity

Recall the aforementioned Hadith:

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abu Sa'eed al Khudri]]:
>  قَالَ خَرَجَ عَلَيْنَا رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ وَنَحْنُ نَتَذَاكَرُ الْمَسِيحَ الدَّجَّالَ
>   فَقَالَ ‏"‏ أَلاَ أُخْبِرُكُمْ بِمَا هُوَ أَخْوَفُ عَلَيْكُمْ عِنْدِي مِنَ الْمَسِيحِ الدَّجَّالِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
>    قَالَ قُلْنَا بَلَى ‏.‏ فَقَالَ ‏"‏ الشِّرْكُ الْخَفِيُّ أَنْ يَقُومَ الرَّجُلُ يُصَلِّي فَيُزَيِّنُ صَلاَتَهُ لِمَا يَرَى مِنْ نَظَرِ رَجُلٍ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to us when we were discussing Dajjal (False Christ) and said:
> 
> ‘Shall I not tell you of that which I fear more for you than Dajjal?’
> 
>  We said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Hidden polytheism, when a man stands to pray and makes it look good because he sees a man looking at him.’”
>  
>  { Sunan Ibn Majah 4204 }

This Hadith mentioned "a man looking at him" - what of thousands looking, as is the case with social media?

## Dangers to the Validity of Actions

Can be looked at through three angles:

1. **Speaking without knowledge**:

> [!quran] [[Al-A'raaf]] ([[7-33]]) 
> 
> قُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّىَ ٱلْفَوَٰحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَٱلْإِثْمَ وَٱلْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِۦ سُلْطَـٰنًۭا ==وَأَن تَقُولُوا۟ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ== ٣٣
> 
> Say, "My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed - and sin, and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allāh that for which He has not sent down authority, **and that you say about Allāh that which you do not know**."

Some of the salaf considered speaking about Allah that which you do not know to be the greatest of sins.

2. **The danger of a lie that spreads:**

> [!hadith] [[Samurah ibn Jundub]] narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said, 
> 
>  ‏ "‏ رَأَيْتُ رَجُلَيْنِ أَتَيَانِي قَالاَ الَّذِي رَأَيْتَهُ يُشَقُّ شِدْقُهُ فَكَذَّابٌ يَكْذِبُ بِالْكَذْبَةِ تُحْمَلُ عَنْهُ حَتَّى تَبْلُغَ الآفَاقَ فَيُصْنَعُ بِهِ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ ‏"‏‏.‏
>  
> I saw (in a dream), two men came to me. They said, 'The person, the one whose cheek you saw being torn away (from the mouth to the ear) was a liar and used to tell lies and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.'
> 
> {{ Sahih al-Bukhari 6096 }}

And this is far easier with social Media

Note: "lie" in Arabic means to say something that is not true, regardless of intention

3. **If you set a bad example, you will get the sins of those who follow you:**

Recall the aforementioned Hadith:

> [!Hadith] [[Jarir ibn Abdillah]] reported
> 
> 
> فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ مَنْ سَنَّ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ سُنَّةً حَسَنَةً فَلَهُ أَجْرُهَا وَأَجْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا بَعْدَهُ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أُجُورِهِمْ شَىْءٌ وَمَنْ سَنَّ فِي الإِسْلاَمِ سُنَّةً سَيِّئَةً كَانَ عَلَيْهِ وِزْرُهَا وَوِزْرُ مَنْ عَمِلَ بِهَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَنْ يَنْقُصَ مِنْ أَوْزَارِهِمْ شَىْءٌ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.
> 
> {{  Sahih Muslim 1017a }}

## Dangers in How Others See You

> [!Hadith] 
> 
> قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ﷺ: 
> 
> إِنَّ مِنْ أَشْرَاطِ السَّاعَةِ أَنْ يُلْتَمَسَ العِلْمُ عِنْدَ الأَصَاغِرِ.
> 
> Indeed from the sings of the Hour is that knowledge will be sought from the juniors.
> 
> { ابْنُ المُبَارَكِ فِي الزُّهْدِ (٦١) }

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] said:
> 
> لَا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ صَالِحِينَ مُتَمَاسِكِينَ مَا أَتَاهُمُ العِلْمُ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ مُحَمَّدٍ ﷺ، وَمِنْ أَكَابِرِهِمْ، فَإِذَا أَتَاهُمْ مِنْ أَصَاغِرِهِمْ هَلَكُوا.
> 
> People will remain righteous and steadfast as long as knowledge comes to them from the Companions of Muhammad ﷺ and from their elders. But when it comes to them from their juniors, they will be ruined.
> 
> { المُعْجَمُ الكَبِيرُ لِلطَّبَرَانِيِّ (٩/١١٤) }

And social media elevates those who are junior.

> [!hadith]  [[Thawban]] narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said: 
> 
> ... وَإِنَّمَا أَخَافُ عَلَى أُمَّتِي الأَئِمَّةَ الْمُضِلِّينَ
> 
> The thing I fear most for my Ummah are the misguiding Imams
> 
> {{ Sunan Abi Dawud 4252 }}

They are the Imams (ie those who have followers) who misguide from the path of Allah, including:
- A ruler that misguides from the path of Allah
- The scholar that misguides from the path of Allah
- The worshipper that misguides out of ignorance

And social media can make an ordinary person an Imam without any qualification.

## Dangers of Money

This danger comes from many angles:

1. **Can cause a loss of sincerity**

> [!hadith]  [[Abu Hurayrah]] narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said
> 
> تَعِسَ عَبْدُ الدِّينَارِ وَعَبْدُ الدِّرْهَمِ وَعَبْدُ الْخَمِيصَةِ، إِنْ أُعْطِيَ رَضِيَ، وَإِنْ لَمْ يُعْطَ سَخِطَ، تَعِسَ وَانْتَكَسَ، وَإِذَا شِيكَ فَلاَ انْتَقَشَ، طُوبَى لِعَبْدٍ آخِذٍ بِعِنَانِ فَرَسِهِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ، أَشْعَثَ رَأْسُهُ مُغْبَرَّةٍ قَدَمَاهُ، إِنْ كَانَ فِي الْحِرَاسَةِ كَانَ فِي الْحِرَاسَةِ، وَإِنْ كَانَ فِي السَّاقَةِ كَانَ فِي السَّاقَةِ، إِنِ اسْتَأْذَنَ لَمْ يُؤْذَنْ لَهُ، وَإِنْ شَفَعَ لَمْ يُشَفَّعْ
> 
> " Let the slave of Dinar and Dirham, of Quantify and Khamisa perish as he is pleased if these things are given to him, and if not, he is displeased. Let such a person perish and relapse, and if he is pierced with a thorn, let him not find anyone to take it out for him. Paradise is for him who holds the reins of his horse to strive in Allah's Cause, with his hair unkempt and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post with satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for permission he is not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted."
> 
> {{ Sahih al-Bukhari 2887 }}

Observe that the Prophet of Rahmah ﷺ made such a harsh Du'a against the person who is a slave to money

2. **Can cause a person to compromise the message**

A person can increase their reach by toning down their message

> [!quran] [[Al-Qalam]] ([[68-9]]) 
> 
> وَدُّوا۟ لَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ ٩
> 
> They wish that you would soften [in your position], so they would soften [toward you].

# Ruling on Taking Money as a Fruit of Seeking Knowledge

For example: being paid to be a teacher, Imam of a masjid, Qur'an teacher, Raqi etc

**The default principle in 'Ibadaat is that the reward should be sought from Allah in the Aakhirah, and that it should not be for the dunya:**

> [!quran] [[Hud]] ([[11-15]] tp [[11-16]]) 
> 
> مَن كَانَ يُرِيدُ ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَزِينَتَهَا نُوَفِّ إِلَيْهِمْ أَعْمَـٰلَهُمْ فِيهَا وَهُمْ فِيهَا لَا يُبْخَسُونَ ١٥
> 
> Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments - We fully repay them for their deeds therein, and they therein will not be deprived.
> 
> أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ لَيْسَ لَهُمْ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ إِلَّا ٱلنَّارُ ۖ وَحَبِطَ مَا صَنَعُوا۟ فِيهَا وَبَـٰطِلٌۭ مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ ١٦
> 
> Those are the ones for whom there is not in the Hereafter but the Fire. And lost is what they did therein, and worthless is what they used to do.

**However, if the 'ibadah has a measurable benefit to the people, the majority of scholars are the view that is permissible to take a wage for it**  

They use as evidence:

> [!hadith]  [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] narrated that the Prophet (ﷺ) said
> 
> إِنَّ أَحَقَّ مَا أَخَذْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا كِتَابُ اللَّهِ
> 
> Indeed, the most deserving thing for which you may take a wage is the Book of Allah
> 
> {{ Sahih al-Bukhari 5737 }}

**But you must remember the dangers of**:
- **Loosing reward completely** (when this becomes your primary motivation)
- **Decreasing reward** (doing for Allah but mixing with a competing intention)

The person should the sole intention to be for the sake of Allah, but were Allah to make it turn into a means for employment, they could accept that without making it a competing motivation.

# Practical Steps to Guard Sincerity in the Digital World

**Wait as long as possible before having a digital presence**. 

When you eventually share that goodness, it will be better.

**Whatever you can keep private, keep private.**

> [!quote] [[Zubayr ibn al-'Awwaam]] said:
> 
> مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ مِنْكُمْ أَنْ يَكُونَ لَهُ خَبْءٌ مِنْ عَمَلٍ صَالِحٍ فَلْيَفْعَلْ.
> 
> Whoever among you is able to have a hidden righteous deed let him do it.
> 
> { المُصَنَّفُ لِابْنِ أَبِي شَيْبَةَ (٧/١٣٣).}

**Be content with being in the back**. 

Keep anonymous where possible.

There is no need to be the face of things. 

**Only post what pleases Allah and not what pleases the people**.

This does not preclude taking into account Hikmah and thinking of consequences of what is posted.

**Question yourself**

Before during and after writing/sharing/recording/posting, ask:
- Why am I doing this?
- Does it need to be public?
- Does it need to be me?

**Check the validity of what you post**

Do not post anything that others have not said before.

Do not post something that is a rare minority position, even if it is right. This is not the time or arena to engage in this, and it should be left to people more knowledgable.

**Do not post on topics that should be left to the senior people of knowledge**

This is an attribute of the attributes of the munafiqin & following the shaytan:

> [!quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4-83]]) 
> 
> وَإِذَا جَآءَهُمْ أَمْرٌۭ مِّنَ ٱلْأَمْنِ أَوِ ٱلْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا۟ بِهِۦ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى ٱلرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰٓ أُو۟لِى ٱلْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ يَسْتَنۢبِطُونَهُۥ مِنْهُمْ ۗ وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُۥ لَٱتَّبَعْتُمُ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًۭا ٨٣
> 
> And when there comes to them something [i.e., information] about [public] security or fear, they spread it around. But if they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it. And if not for the favor of Allāh upon you and His mercy, you would have followed Satan, except for a few.

For example, matters of politics, countries, wars, takfir etc

Leave these matters to the most senior people. If they are silent, then follow them in silence. If they are wrong in silence, you will not be blamed, but they will be asked.

**Do not post when emotional**

**Do not post about your daily life**

**Consider setting limits for posting**

eg a maximum number of posts per day

**Belittle your knowledge and question your judgement**

> [!quote] [['Abbaad ibn 'Abbaad al-Khawaas]] said:
> 
> اتَّهِمُوا رَأْيَكُمْ وَرَأْيَ أَهْلِ زَمَانِكُمْ.
> 
> Be critical of your opinion and the opinion of the people of your time.
> 
> {مُسْنَدُ الدَّارِمِيِّ (٦٧٥)}

**Do not allow people to praise you**

Memorise the following du'a, to be said when someone praises you:

> [!quote]
> 
 اللَّهُمَّ لَا تُؤَاخِذْنِي بِمَا يَقُولُونَ، وَاغْفِرْ لِي مَا لَا يَعْلَمُونَ، وَاجْعَلْنِي خَيْرًا مِمَّا يَظُنُّونَ.
> 
> O Allah, do not take me to account for what they say about me, forgive me for what they do not know, and make me better than what they think of me.
> 
> شُعَبُ الإِيمَانِ لِلْبَيْهَقِيِّ (٤٨٧٦)

**Hate fame, and do not wish to be the one that other people follow**

> [!quote] [[Abd al-Rahman ibn abi Laylah]] said 
> 
> أَدْرَكْت عِشْرِينَ وَمِائَةً مِنْ الْأَنْصَارِ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ - صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ - مَا مِنْهُمْ رَجُلٌ يُسْأَلُ عَنْ شَيْءٍ إلَّا وَدَّ أَنَّ أَخَاهُ كَفَاهُ، وَلَا يُحَدِّثُ حَدِيثًا إلَّا وَدَّ أَنَّ أَخَاهُ كَفَاهُ.
> 
> I met 120 of the companions, and there is no one who spoke except that he wished his brother would speak on his behalf, and there is no one who would give a fatwa except that he would wish his brother to give a fatwa on his behalf

**Do not look at praise or criticism, but have others do it**

Shaykh says that he personally does not read comments, but has someone to read the feedback and summarise it for him.

**Do not look at numbers**

Switch off the like and view counters on posts and so on.

> [!quote] [[Ibrahim ibn Adham]] once passed by a study circle of [[Bishr al-Haafi]] and objected to it (owing to the size of the gathering), saying:
> 
> 
> وَمَرَّ إِبْرَاهِيمُ بْنُ أَدْهَمَ عَلَى حَلْقَةِ بِشْرِ الحَافِي فَأَنْكَرَ عَلَيْهِ وَقَالَ:
> 
> لَوْ كَانَتْ هٰذِهِ الحَلْقَةُ لِأَحَدٍ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ ﷺ، مَا أَمِنَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ العُجْبَ.
> 
> If this gathering belonged to one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he would not feel safe from becoming impressed with himself.
> 
> كِتَابُ غَيْثِ النَّفْعِ فِي القِرَاءَاتِ السَّبْع (ص ٦٥٦).

**Do not't make your intention for studying to earn money**

Only consider this if it comes to you without you seeking it, and it is a way to allow you maximise the benefit (eg by teaching full time)

**Be careful with monetisation, especially when it is linked to views and followers**
