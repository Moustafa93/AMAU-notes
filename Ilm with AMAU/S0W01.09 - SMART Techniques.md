# The SMART Framework for Goal Setting

Goals should be:

**Specific**

**Measurable**

**Achievable**

**Relevant**

**Time-bound**

Generally speaking, goals should be those that are achievable within a one year timeframe, though this will vary from person to person, and goal to goal.

Goals more than one year are more of long-term goals, or long-term visions, which are good to have in the background, but not to be relied upon for day to day motivation.

# Systems Wot Willpower

A system is any structure that nudges you to a certain action without relying on will power

Examples of setting up such systems:

**Remove decisions** 

For example study at the same exact time and place every day. No need to decide each day. 

**Lower activation energy** 

Make starting the work easy - set yourself a small easy target that you will not miss.

For example, "I will watch 5 minutes". This will usually end up with watching more. 

*Focus on starting not finishing, the momentum will carry you through*

**Make good behaviour easy and bad behavior hard** 

Particularly in digital environment, eg blockers on social media etc

**Fixed routine, not flexible plans**

**Accountability**

Examples:
- The Tarbiyyah tract
- Deadlines with real consequences.
- Habit trackers shared with others

This is not about showing off, but rather:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ma'idah]] ([[5-2]]) 
> 
>  وَتَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْبِرِّ وَٱلتَّقْوَىٰ ۖ وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا۟ عَلَى ٱلْإِثْمِ وَٱلْعُدْوَٰنِ ۚ
> 
> And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression.
> 

**Community**

Surrounding yourself with people who already have the behaviour you want.

No longer about "do I feel motivated today" but "what do people like us do"

Examples include study groups, online communities etc.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Kahf]] ([[18-28]]) 
> 
> وَٱصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَدَوٰةِ وَٱلْعَشِىِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُۥ ۖ 
> 
> And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His face

**Self compassion**

Being merciful to yourself. 

When you fall short or fail, adjust, but do not be harsh on yourself.
