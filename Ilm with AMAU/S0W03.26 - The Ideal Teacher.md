# The Two Essential Qualities of a Teacher
[1:29](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578982&permalink=26-the-ideal-teacher#1:29) 

As the poet said:
> تَأْخُذُهُ عَلَىٰ مُفِيدٍ نَاصِحٍ

The teacher should be:

- Beneficial | مُفِيد
- Sincere | نَاصِح

## The Beneficial Teacher (مُفِيد)
[1:44](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578982&permalink=26-the-ideal-teacher#1:44) 

The teacher should be:

- **Qualified** to teach that text to you

	This is about capability rather than a particular type of formal qualification/certificate
	
- **Specialised** in the subject they are teaching you (to the appropriate extent to the level that you are at)

	This becomes more important as the level of study increases

	A teacher who is highly specialised in the subject may be able to provide more benefit regarding the subtleties and finer points than someone who is more senior than them but not specialised in the subject.

	Though from the more senior shaykh, you additionally benefit from their:
	- Seniority
	- Wisdom
	- Experience
	- Tarbiyyah

**At a minimum, the teacher should be at least one level beyond the one that they are taking you to.**

> [!quote] As per the famous Arabic proverb:
> 
> فَاقِدُ الشَّيْءِ لَا يُعْطِيهِ.
> 
> One who lacks something cannot give it.
> 
> {{ Muʿjam Al-Lugha Al-ʿArabiyya Al-Muʿāṣira (3/1729) }}

You do not need to study everything from the senior scholars - a junior teacher may be able to get you to the next stage. The junior teacher may even be specialised in taking people from "level 1" to "level 2", in which case they may be of more benefit at that stage.

### Senior and Junior Teachers
[10:08](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578982&permalink=26-the-ideal-teacher#10:08) 

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Umayyah Al Jumahi]] narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said
> 
مِن أشراطِ السَّاعةِ أن يُلتَمَسَ العِلمُ عِندَ الأصاغِرِ 
>
>"From the signs of the hour is that knowledge will be sought from those who are junior"
>
>  { Ibn Mubarak - Al-Zuhd,  61 }

**Meaning of "junior" in the Hadith**:

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mubarak]] was asked: "who are the juniors?" He said:
> 
> الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ بِرَأْيِهِمْ، فَأَمَّا صَغِيرٌ يَرْوِي عَنْ كَبِيرٍ فَلَيْسَ بِصَغِيرٍ
> 
> They are those are those who speaks from their own oppinions. As for a junior person who narrates from a senior person, this person is not a junior (ie not what is meant by the Hadith)
> 
> { Ibn Mubarak - Al-Zuhd,  1/21 }

It is normal and expected to begin studying with those who are junior. But you must ensure that the junior teacher you study with knows their own limits, and quote those who are more senior than them, rather than giving their owns views.

## The Sincere Teacher (نَاصِح)
[14:01](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578982&permalink=26-the-ideal-teacher#14:01) 

> [!definition] نَصِيحَة
> 
> إِرَادَةُ الْخَيْرِ لِلْمَنْصُوحِ.
> 
> Wanting good for the one you're giving Naseehah to.

This definition should be memorised, as it is so often mistranslated to "advice". Advice is only part of it, but it's essence is about wanting good for a person, and so behaving in a way that is in the interest of that person.

**So you need a teacher who wants good for you.**

The teacher should be:

- **Sincere**

	Cannot know if someone is sincere, but avoid red flags (e.g. motivated only by money)

- **Nurturing** - A murabbi, not just a mudarris

	The teacher cares about you, and helps you along the path.

> [!quran] [[Aal 'Imran]] ([[3-79]]) 
> 
> مَا كَانَ لِبَشَرٍ أَن يُؤْتِيَهُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْحُكْمَ وَٱلنُّبُوَّةَ ثُمَّ يَقُولَ لِلنَّاسِ كُونُوا۟ عِبَادًۭا لِّى مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلَـٰكِن **==كُونُوا۟ رَبَّـٰنِيِّـۧنَ==** بِمَا كُنتُمْ تُعَلِّمُونَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَبِمَا كُنتُمْ تَدْرُسُونَ ٧٩
> 
> It is not for a human [prophet] that Allāh should give him the Scripture and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people, "Be servants to me rather than Allāh," but [instead, he would say], "Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied."

> [!Definition] The Nuturing Scholar | الرَّبَّانِيُّ  
> 
> [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] defined the word as:
> 
> الرَّبَّانِيُّ الَّذِي يُرَبِّي النَّاسَ بِصِغَارِ الْعِلْمِ قَبْلَ كِبَارِهِ.
> 
> “The Rabbānī is the one who nurtures people with the basics of knowledge before its advanced parts.”
> 
> مِنْ مُعَلَّقَاتِ الْبُخَارِيِّ قَبْلَ حَدِيثٍ (٦٨)

# Doubting the teacher
[23:42](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578982&permalink=26-the-ideal-teacher#23:42) 

One of the tricks of Shaytan is to make a person doubt their teacher.

This trick can come in two forms:
- **Shubuhaat** - e.g. thinking bad of the teacher
- **Shahawaat** - e.g. desire to move from teacher to teacher, and curriculum to curriculum

So stick to your teacher, and only change when there is a clear and provable benefit in doing so.

Sticking to something that is 70% beneficial is better than moving from course to course and never benefiting. 

# How to Benefit From Your Teacher
[26:18](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578982&permalink=26-the-ideal-teacher#26:18) 

During the lesson, you must:

**Pay attention**

- Listen actively.
- Concentrate on what is being said. 
- Act like a student of knowledge: dress, sit and behave properly in the lesson, even in a pre-recorded online class.

**Take notes**

This is part of active listening.

Do not expect notes to be given to you. This is a bad habit that will harm you as time goes on:
- you do not develop the ability to take notes
- notes are deeply personal, there are good and bad habits, but no absolute right or wrong method

## Phases of Taking Notes
[27:19](https://www.amauacademy.com/programs/the-correct-method-week-3?cid=4578982&permalink=26-the-ideal-teacher#27:19) 

1. **Capture phase** 

	Capture the benefits that you can.
	
	These are the things that will benefit you in terms of actions and changes in your life. This is not about exams.

2. **Write the notes up**

- Organise and neaten the notes.
- Gather and verify the evidences, making sure you have the shaahid for each.

3. **Review your notes**

- Once a week -  review the notes of the current subject
- Before exams -  review the subject you will be tested on
- Once a year -  review everything you have studied

3. **Consolidate your notes**

- Condense the notes down 
- Write them onto texts
