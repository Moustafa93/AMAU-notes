Imaan is the oldest word used for 'Aqeedah

# Connection of Imaan to the Sahadatayn

First pillar of Islam:
أشهد ان لا اله إلا الله وأشهد أن محمداً رسول الله


**This pillar is about verbalising ones Imaan** - قول اللسان

# Iman and Islam

In the Hadith of Jibril:
- The Pillars of Islam are outward actions
- The Pillars of Imaan are inward actions

**The inner and outer self require one another**. It is not allowed to have an inner Iman with no outer expression, nor an outer Iman with no inner reality.

So ones Iman has to be expressed verbally and through action, ie through the pillars of Islam

> [!Quran] [[Al-Munafiqun]] ([[63-1]]) 
> 
> إِذَا جَآءَكَ ٱلْمُنَـٰفِقُونَ قَالُوا۟ ==نَشْهَدُ== إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُۥ وَٱللَّهُ يَشْهَدُ إِنَّ ٱلْمُنَـٰفِقِينَ لَكَـٰذِبُونَ ١
> 
> When the hypocrites come to you, [O Muḥammad], they say, "We testify that you are the Messenger of Allāh." And Allāh knows that you are His Messenger, and Allāh testifies that the hypocrites are liars.

There is no benefit to an inner Iman with no outer expression and vice versa.

We need an Iman that:
- consits of beliefs
- that is affirmed by the actions of the heart
- that expressed by the statements of the tongue
- that is acted upon by the limbs

This comprehensive understanding of Iman is found in Hadith of Jibril, where the outer part described by Islam, and inner part is described by Iman.

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Al-Nu'man ibn Bashir]], that the Messenger ﷺ said:
> 
> أَلاَ وَإِنَّ فِي الْجَسَدِ مُضْغَةً إِذَا صَلَحَتْ صَلَحَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ، وَإِذَا فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ‏.‏ أَلاَ وَهِيَ الْقَلْبُ 
> 
> Beware, in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, and hearken it is the heart.
> 
> {{ Bukhari 52 & Muslim 1599 }}

Benefit: 
- There is a connection between the inner self and the outer self.
- If Imān is in the heart it will show itself upon the limbs.

The Murji'a denied actions as part of belief. They were described by [[Ibn Abi Dawud]] as-Sijistaani:

> [!poem] [[Ibn Abi Dawud]] said in his al-Haa'iyyah:
> لاَ تَكُ مُرْجِيًّا لَعُوْبًا بِدِيْنِهِ ... أَلاَ إِنَّمَا المُرْجِيُّ بِالدِّيْنِ يَمْزَحُ
> 
> Do not be a playful Murji’ regarding his religion ... Verily, the Murji’ is playing with the religion
> 
> 
> وَقُلْ: إِنَّمَا الإِيْمَانُ قَوْلٌ وَنِيَّةٌ ... وَفِعْلٌ عَلَى قَوْلِ النَّبِيِّ مُصَرَّحُ
> 
> And say: Verily, faith is statement and intention ... And action, as the Prophet explicitly said
> 
> 
> وَيَنْقُصُ طَوْرًا بِالمَعَاصِي وَتَارَةً ... بِطَاعَتِهِ يَنْمَى وَفِي الوَزْنِ يَرْجَحُ
> 
> And it decreases sometimes with sins, and other times ... It grows with obedience, and it outweighs in the balance

**Mistakes in Aqeedah lead to real problems in peoples life.**

The one who removes actions from Iman takes there religion as a joke, like the Murji'

This is common these days. A person with no outward Islamic practice will claim strong Iman and say "only Allah can judge me, Allah knows what is in my heart".

## When mentioned separately vs together

> [!Quote] [[Ibn Rajab]] said:
> 
> فَهَكَذَا اسْمُ الْإِسْلَامِ وَالْإِيمَانِ إِذَا أُفْرِدَ أَحَدُهُمَا دَخَلَ فِيهِ الْآخَرُ، وَدَلَّ بِانْفِرَادِهِ عَلَى مَا يَدُلُّ عَلَيْهِ الْآخَرُ بِانْفِرَادِهِ، فَإِذَا قُرِنَ بَيْنَهُمَا دَلَّ أَحَدُهُمَا عَلَى بَعْضِ مَا يَدُلُّ عَلَيْهِ بِانْفِرَادِهِ وَدَلَّ الْآخَرُ عَلَى الْبَاقِي، وَقَدْ صَرَّحَ بِهَذَا جَمَاعَةٌ مِنَ الْأَئِمَّةِ.

### Examples where Islam and Iman are Mentioned Separately

> [!Quran] [[Aal 'Imran]] ([[3-19]]) 
> 
> ==إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْإِسْلَـٰمُ ۗ== وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْيًۢا بَيْنَهُمْ ۗ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِـَٔايَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ ١٩
> 
> Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allāh is Islām. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allāh, then indeed, Allāh is swift in [taking] account.

The meaning of Islam here is not limited only to ones outer actions.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ma'idah]] ([[5-5]]) 
> 
> ...  وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱلْإِيمَـٰنِ فَقَدْ حَبِطَ عَمَلُهُۥ وَهُوَ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ مِنَ ٱلْخَـٰسِرِينَ ٥
> 
>  ... And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.

The meaning of Imaan here is not limited only to the inner beliefs.

### Examples where Islam and Iman are Mentioned Together

1. **Outward vs Inward**

For example, [[Hadith of Jibril]]:

- Iman = inward actions of belief and affirmation
- Islam = outward actions of the tongue and the limbs

Islām refers to the outwards actions, and Imān refers to the inward actions made up of belief and affirmation.

2. **Islam as submission, and Iman as conviction and affirmation**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Hujurat]] ([[49-14]]) 
> 
> ۞ قَالَتِ ٱلْأَعْرَابُ ءَامَنَّا ۖ قُل لَّمْ تُؤْمِنُوا۟ وَلَـٰكِن قُولُوٓا۟ أَسْلَمْنَا وَلَمَّا يَدْخُلِ ٱلْإِيمَـٰنُ فِى قُلُوبِكُمْ ۖ وَإِن تُطِيعُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥ لَا يَلِتْكُم مِّنْ أَعْمَـٰلِكُمْ شَيْـًٔا ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌۭ رَّحِيمٌ ١٤
> 
> The bedouins say, "We have believed." Say, "You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted,' for faith has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey Allāh and His Messenger, He will not deprive you from your deeds of anything. Indeed, Allāh is Forgiving and Merciful."

Here, Iman is a level above Islam:
- Iman = conviction and affirmation
- Islam = submission

3. **Islam as the bare minimum, Iman as the obligations, Ihsan as the voluntary actions**

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] narrated:
> 
> 
> أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ "‏ لاَ يَزْنِي الزَّانِي حِينَ يَزْنِي وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ وَلاَ يَسْرِقُ حِينَ يَسْرِقُ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ وَلاَ يَشْرَبُ الْخَمْرَ حِينَ يَشْرَبُهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ وَالتَّوْبَةُ مَعْرُوضَةٌ بَعْدُ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> A fornicator who fornicates is not a believer as long as he commits fornication, and no one who steals is a believer as long as he commits theft, and no one who drinks wine is a believer as long as he drinks it, and repentance may be accepted after that.
> 
> {{ Muslim 57f }}

Here, we have the following levels:
- Islam - Bare minimum that keeps you a Muslim
- Iman - Fulfilling obligations and avoiding that which is Haraam
- Ihsan - striving to do voluntary deeds

   
**These three overlap, but have nuance**

# Impressibility of Al Istithnaa (الإستثناء) in Iman but not for Islam

The Murjiah did not allow someone to say “I have Iman, In sha Allah”.

For them,  the statement is as though the person is doubting that they are a Muslim.

For Ahlul Sunnah, it is permissible to say, “I have Iman, In sha Allah”, intending Iman as a level above Islam.
