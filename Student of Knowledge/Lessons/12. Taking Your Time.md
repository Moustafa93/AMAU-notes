> [!Hadith] Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Arat
> كَانَ الرَّجُلُ فِيمَنْ قَبْلَكُمْ يُحْفَرُ لَهُ فِي الأَرْضِ فَيُجْعَلُ فِيهِ، فَيُجَاءُ بِالْمِنْشَارِ، فَيُوضَعُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ فَيُشَقُّ بِاثْنَتَيْنِ، وَمَا يَصُدُّهُ ذَلِكَ عَنْ دِينِهِ، وَيُمْشَطُ بِأَمْشَاطِ الْحَدِيدِ، مَا دُونَ لَحْمِهِ مِنْ عَظْمٍ أَوْ عَصَبٍ، وَمَا يَصُدُّهُ ذَلِكَ عَنْ دِينِهِ، وَاللَّهِ لَيُتِمَّنَّ هَذَا الأَمْرَ حَتَّى يَسِيرَ الرَّاكِبُ مِنْ صَنْعَاءَ إِلَى حَضْرَمَوْتَ، لاَ يَخَافُ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ أَوِ الذِّئْبَ عَلَى غَنَمِهِ، وَلَكِنَّكُمْ تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ ‏"‏‏.‏
> 
> We complained to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (of the persecution inflicted on us by the infidels) while he was sitting in the shade of the Ka'ba, leaning over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, "Would you seek help for us? Would you pray to Allah for us?" He said, "Among the nations before you a (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty.
> 
> { [Bukhari 3612](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3612) }

In this Hadith, the Prophet SAW tells us the nature of mankind is to be hasty, to rush and to want things to fast. What we have to do is to slow down and trust in Allah that thinks will happen in the end.

> [!Hadith] Narrated ibn Abbas
> إِنَّ فِيكَ خَصْلَتَيْنِ يُحِبُّهُمَا اللَّهُ الْحِلْمُ وَالأَنَاةُ

> 
> { [Muslim 17c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:17c) }

So these are two characteristics that Allah loves, and here we want to focus on الأَنَاة, or deliberateness

> [!Quote] Ibn Shihab al Zuhri said to Yunus 
>  يَا يُونُسُ، «لَا تُكَابِرِ الْعِلْمَ؛ فَإِنَّ الْعِلْمَ أَوْدِيَةٌ , فَأَيُّهَا أَخَذْتَ فِيهِ قَطَعَ بِكَ قَبْلَ أَنْ تَبْلُغَهُ وَلَكِنْ خُذْهُ مَعَ الْأَيَّامِ وَاللَّيَالِي، وَلَا تَأْخُذِ الْعِلْمَ جُمْلَةً؛ فَإِنَّ مَنْ رَامَ أَخْذَهُ جُمْلَةً ذَهَبَ عَنْهُ جُمْلَةً وَلَكِنِ الشَّيْءُ بَعْدَ الشَّيْءِ مَعَ اللَّيَالِي وَالْأَيَّامِ
>  
>  O Yunus, don't make knowledge bigger than it needs to be. Knowledge is a series of valies. Whichever of them you start to cross will leave you drained before you reach it. Rather, take it with the passing of the days and the nights. And don't take knowledge in one go. For whoever sets about taking it in one go, it will leave him in one go. But take one bit after another with the passage of the nights and the days.

And such is how we should approach the video lessons of AMAU: take them slowly with the passage of the days and the nights. Do not rush through lesson after lesson, until you exhaust yourself and do not reach the destination.

> [!Quote] The advice of Hammaad to Abu Hanifa - learn three matters
> فَقَامَ أَبُو حَنِيفَةَ فَأَتَى حَمَّادًا , فَقَالَ لَهُ: مَا جَاءَ بِكَ؟ قَالَ: أَطْلُبُ الْفِقْهَ قَالَ: تَعَلَّمْ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ ثَلَاثَ مَسَائِلَ وَلَا تَزِدْ عَلَيْهَا شَيْئًا حَتَّى يَتَّفِقَ لَكَ شَيْءٌ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ فَفَعَلَ , وَلَزِمَ الْحَلَقَةَ حَتَّى فَقِهَ , فَكَانَ النَّاسُ يُشِيرُونَ إِلَيْهِ بِالْأَصَابِعِ

{ Al Faqih Wal Mutafaqih 2/201 }

One of the subtle points here: do not take on more until you have tested yourself and seen that you can manage the small amount consistently. Then you can add more.

# Sticking to the Scholars

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Umayyah Al Jumahi]] narrated
> عَن أبي أمَيَّةَ الجُمَحيِّ رَضِيَ الله عَنه أنَّ رَسولَ الله صلَّى اللهُ عليه وسلَّم قال: 
((مِن أشراطِ السَّاعةِ أن يُلتَمَسَ العِلمُ عِندَ الأصاغِرِ ))
>
>"Indeed, from the signs of the hour is that knowledge will be sought from those who are junior"

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] (d 32 AH) said:
>  لا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا أَتَاهُمُ الْعِلْمُ مِنْ قِبَلِ أَصْحَابِ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَأَكَابِرِهِمْ فَإِذَا أَتَاهُمُ الْعِلْمُ مِنْ قِبَلِ أَصَاغِرِهِمْ فَذَلِكَ حِينَ هَلَكُوا
> 
> People will not cease to be upon good, as long as their knowledge comes to them from the Companions of the Prophet (SAW) and their seniors. When their knowledge comes from their juniors, this is when they will be destroyed.
 >
 { al-Tabarani }

Note regarding the two previous narrations: the word "أصاغِر" and "أَكَابِر" could refer to junior/senior in age or  in knowledge. Which is intended will be explained shortly

> [!question] How does AMAU fit into this context? 

> [!Question] If AMAU does not make the claim of being from the senior scholars, how does AMAU not harm to students?
> 1. All the knowledge in AMAU is taken from the senior scholars (of the past and the recent times)
> 2. AMAU is not the goal, but a means to access the senior scholars 
> 3. The goal of AMAU is to connect the students with the scholars, and for the students to eventually exceed the level of AMAUs

If you see AMAU is the final goal, then that could be problematic. If you see it is a stepping stone (to address temporary issues of language barriers, location, level), then this is what is intended.

## Junior means not junior in age but those who have deviated form the Sunnah

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mubarak]] said:
> الْأَصَاغِرُ أَهْلُ الْبِدَعِ
> 
> The Juniors are the people of innovatrion

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mubarak]] also said:
> الَّذِينَ يَقُولُونَ بِرَأْيِهِمْ، فَأَمَّا صَغِيرٌ يَرْوِي عَنْ كَبِيرٍ فَلَيْسَ بِصَغِيرٍ
> 
> They are those are those who speaks from their own oppinions. As for a junior person who narrates from a senior person, this person is not a junior (ie not what is meant by the Hadith)

And so this is what AMAU are trying to do. 

AMAU is not trying to be the seniors, but is instead narrating from the seniors.

> [!Quote] [[Ibrahim al-Harbi]] (d 285 AH) said:
> الصَّغِيرَ إِذَا أَخَذَ بِقَوْلِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَالصَّحَابَةِ وَالتَّابِعِينَ فَهُوَ كَبِيرٌ , وَالشَّيْخُ الْكَبِيرُ إِنْ أَخَذَ بِقَوْلِ أَبِي حَنِيفَةَ وَتَرَكَ السُّنَنَ فَهُوَ صَغِيرٌ 
> 
> The junior person, if they take the statement of the Messenger of Allah (SAW) and the Sahaba and the Tab'iyeen, then they are a senior person (ie not intended in the aforementioned Hadith).
> 
> And the old man/senior person of knowledge, if they abandon the Sunnah, then they are considered to be from the juniors

---

> [!Quote] [[Abu Ishaaq al-Shaatibi]] (d 790 AH) said:
> وَإِذَا ثَبَتَ أَنَّهُ لَا بُدَّ مِنْ أَخْذِ الْعِلْمِ عَنْ أَهْلِهِ؛ فَلِذَلِكَ طَرِيقَانِ:أَحَدُهُمَا:الْمُشَافَهَةُ، وَهِيَ أَنْفَعُ الطَّرِيقَيْنِ وَأَسْلَمُهُمَا؛الطَّرِيقُ الثَّانِي: مُطَالَعَةُ كُتُبِ الْمُصَنِّفِينَ وَمُدَوِّنِي الدَّوَاوِينَ، وَهُوَ أَيْضًا نَافِعٌ فِي بَابِهِ؛بِشَرْطَيْنِ:الْأَوَّلُ:أَنْ يَحْصُلَ لَهُ مِنْ فَهْمِ مَقَاصِدِ ذَلِكَ الْعِلْمِ الْمَطْلُوبِ، وَمَعْرِفَةِ اصْطِلَاحَاتِ أَهْلِهِ؛وَالشَّرْطُ الْآخَرُ١: أَنْ يَتَحَرَّى كُتُبَ الْمُتَقَدِّمِينَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْعِلْمِ الْمُرَادِ؛فَإِنَّهُمْ أَقْعَدُ٢ بِهِ مِنْ غَيْرِهِمْ مِنَ الْمُتَأَخِّرِينَ، وَأَصْلُ ذَلِكَ التَّجْرِبَةُ وَالْخَبَرُ
> 
> And if it is authentically proven that we have to take knowledge from it's people, then there are two ways to do it:
> 1. Directly from their mouths (and this is the best and safest of the two)
> 2. That you read the books of the authors (or those who organised the knowledge into structured writing) and those who compiled it, and this is also beneficial with two conditions.
>    
> The first condition:  the student has acheived enough understanding of the *purpose* of that knowledge that is sought, as well as an understanding of *terminology* of it's people
> 
> The second condition: the student seeks out the books of the *earlier scholars*, as they are more established than the books of the later scholars  
> 
> { Al-Muwaafaqaat }

The first condition brings the meaning of the statement:

> [!Quote]
>Knowledge was in the chest of men, and it was transferred into books, and the keys to it are in the hands of men.

This is why AMAU includes a madkhal for each science - so the students understand the purpose and the terminology. As such, the first condition is fulfilled.

The second condition is fulfilled by the selection of books in the curriculum.

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] said
> مَنْ كَانَ مُسْتَنًّا فَلْيَسْتَنَّ بِمَنْ قَدْ مَاتَ؛ فَإِنَّ الْحَيَّ لَا تُؤْمَنُ عَلَيْهِ الْفِتْنَةُ، أُولَئِكَ أَصْحَابُ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ كَانُوا أَفْضَلَ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ؛ أَبَرُّهَا قُلُوبًا، وَأَعْمَقُهَا عِلْمًا، وَأَقَلُّهَا تَكَلُّفًا، اخْتَارَهُمْ اللَّهُ لِصُحْبَةِ نَبِيِّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَلِإِقَامَةِ دِينِهِ، فَاعْرِفُوا لَهُمْ فَضْلَهُمْ، وَاتَّبِعُوهُمْ عَلَى أَثَرِهِمْ، وَتَمَسَّكُوا بِمَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ مِنْ أَخْلَاقِهِمْ وَسِيَرِهِمْ، فَإِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا عَلَى الْهَدْيِ الْمُسْتَقِيمِ
> 
> 
> Whoever wants to follow someone, let him follow someone who has died. For the living are not safe from fitnah.
> 
> I mean the Companions of the Muhammad SAW. They are the purest in heats, deepest in knowledge and least in burdening. Allah chose them to accompany his Prophet SAW and to establish His religion. So recognize their status and follow their footsteps, and adhere as much as you can to their conduct and attitude, for they were upon true guidance.

This is another one of the fundamental points upon which AMAU is built - taking from the scholars who have passed away.

> [!important]  As for those who are still living, we do not know what they will do tomorrow. 

# Memorization and understanding

## The Importance of Understanding

> [!Quran] [Al-'Ankabut (29:43)](https://quran.com/29/43)
> وَتِلْكَ ٱلْأَمْثَـٰلُ نَضْرِبُهَا لِلنَّاسِ ۖ وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَآ إِلَّا ٱلْعَـٰلِمُونَ ٤٣
> 
> These are the parables We set forth for humanity, but none will understand them except the people of knowledge.

> [!Question]  What does this Ayah tell us about what it means to have knowledge? 
> The scholars and people of knowledge are those who understand and properly appreciate the meaning of the text of revelation.

Many people know the words of the text. But it is the people of knowledge who know the meaning of the text, comprehend it and internalize it.

> 
> And We gave understanding of it [i.e., the case] to Solomon, and to each [of them] We gave judgement and knowledge. And We subjected the mountains to exalt [Us], along with David and [also] the birds. And We were doing [that].

> [!question]  What does this Ayah tell us about what it means to have knowledge? 
>  Understanding differs from person to person, even if they are both people of knowledge.

> 
> Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’ān that you might understand.

> [!question]  What does this Ayah tell us about what it means to have knowledge?

When the Prophet SAW said this, Abu Bakr understood that this meant that he was going to die, while no one else present understood this.

> I asked 'Ali, "Do you have the knowledge of any Divine Inspiration besides what is in Allah's Book?" 'Ali replied, "No, by Him Who splits the grain of corn and creates the soul. I don't think we have such knowledge, but we have the ability of understanding which Allah may endow a person with, so that he may understand the Qur'an, and we have what is written in this paper as well." I asked, "What is written in this paper?" He replied, "(The regulations of) blood-money, the freeing of captives, and the judgment that no Muslim should be killed for killing an infidel."
> 
> { [Bukhari 3047](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:3047) }

 Context: There were a lot of rumours regarding Ali, as to whether he had secret knowledge or instructions from the Prophet SAW (eg what should happen with regards to rulership). This only increased after his death. These were all from the shubuhaat of the Rafidah - this Hadith clearly answers that.

What Ustadh intended from this is the statement "إِلاَّ فَهْمًا" (except for understanding). So here 'Ali tells us what he had that made him different was the understanding of the Quran, and not secret knowledge or instructions that he kept back from the people.

> [!Benefit] Side benefit:

Both of them knew the ayaat. But 'Ali here understood what others did not understand.

Note: [[Imam Maalik]] mentions that it reached him, and does not quote the chain, and the story is narrated about other companions also with variations.(eg [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] with [[Omar ibn al-Khattab]]). But this is the well known version.

ie we are not comparing the one who does not understand Arabic with the one who does, or the one who has the basic understanding with the one who doesn't. 

We are comparing those with the same memorisation and basic understanding, yet they differ in their deep understanding.

## The Importance of memorisation

>  بَلْ هُوَ ءَايَـٰتٌۢ بَيِّنَـٰتٌۭ فِى صُدُورِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ ۚ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَٔايَـٰتِنَآ إِلَّا ٱلظَّـٰلِمُونَ ٤٩
>  
>  Rather, it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is distinct verses [preserved] within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers.

Here, Allah directly connects the people of knowledge with memorisation. And did not mention anything about them except for their memorising.

Important points:
- This was said to a **young child**, because they have the ability and time to memorise before learning more. As for the older person, they may not have the time, and there is more urgency to learn (eg essential and obligatory matters).
- The early generations **did not used to consider memorising the Quran to be seeking knowledge**, but it was a prerequisite to seeking knowledge.

ie if it is not memorised (as you would not take your books into the bathroom).

You cannot call knowledge something that you open a book and read (or search on the internet and read.) That may be skill in research, or notes that one has taken, but it is not knowledge

## Balancing between memorisation and understanding

What precedes are two sections. The first emphasising the importance of memorisation over understanding. The second emphasising the importance of understanding over memorisation. 

How can we reconcile these?

We have to understand in order to act, but you do not have to have memorised it word for word.

But if you do not give memorisation importance, then you will end disconnected from the knowledge that you gained - you will encounter a situation and will not know what to do if you are without your books.

> [!important] 
> Do not consider memorisation to be the be all and end all. And do not consider memorisation to have no value.

> [!Quote] This is why both [[Imam Ahmad]] and [[Yahya ibn Ma'een]] said:
> الحِفظُ: الإتقان
> 
> Memorisation is precision/exactitude

ie the more you memorise, the more precise you will be over the details, and the stronger your understanding will be.

## How to approach memorisation

### There are two types of memorization:

1. Word for word memorisation
	- For Quran, Hadith, Mutoon and Poetry
- Partial memorisation
	- You remember where the quote is located, and you have the gist of it, perhaps one sentence of the paragraph memorised word for word
	- Used for larger works and longer statements of the scholars. eg Tafsir Ibn Kathir
	- Obtained from reading a lot, and perhaps memorising key quotes

> [!Quote] [[Ibn Abi Haatim Al Warraq]] asked [[Imam al Bukhari]]
> هَلْ مِنْ دوَاءٍ يشربُهُ الرَّجُلُ، فينتفعُ بِهِ لِلْحفظِ؟فَقَالَ: لاَ أَعْلَمُ، ثُمَّ أَقبلَ عليَّ، وَقَالَ: لاَ أَعْلَمُ شَيْئاً أَنْفَعَ لِلْحفظِ مِنْ نَهْمَةِ الرَّجُلِ، وَمُدَاومَةِ النَّظَرِ

> He asked Imam al Bukhari: Is there a medicine that someone can take to benefit their memorisation?
> 
> Bukhari responded "I do not know of one. I do not know of anything more beneficial for memrozation than a man's desire (motivation), and constantly looking (at the thing to be memorised)"

One of the mistakes of the people who have memorised Quran is to no longer look at the mushaf. Need to give some of the time to looking at the words.

### How to memorise

(Tips and tricks for memorisation will be discussed in detail elswhere elsewhere)

#### The variables of memorisation

There are two major variables that can be adjusted in memorisation:

1. The amount you memorise in one sitting
2. The amount you repeat it in the sitting.

Aim to start with the first as small as possible, and the second as large as possible. 

And the amount of repetition is far in excess than you would think. You may think 5 times, while in reality it is closer to 50. You can divide memorisation into true memorisation and false memorisation, where false memorisation is where you give yourself the impression that you have memorised it, but it goes quickly.

Then gradually increase the amount that you memorise, and reduce the amount that you repeat, until you find a happy medium between the two.

Memory is a muscle that needs to be trained, ones capacity will increase over time.

It is also important to link that which is memorised, rather than memorising things separately. eg ensuring that one connects a newly memorised page to the previous page

#### Memorisation is of three types:

- **New memorisation (الحفظ الجديد)**
    - Should only be started if there are no issues in the recent or old memorisation
- **Recent, or "nearly new", memorisation (الحفظ القريب)**
    - This is most likely to be lost, so is the first priority for review.
- **Old memorisation (الحفظ القديم)**
	- Well settled in the mind, but still requires regular revision - usually divided over several days with a daily repeating portion
	- If any mistakes are spotted, they should be given the highest priority, so that you do not lose what you have already gained

Students often overestimate that which they have memorised. ie they feel they have memorised 5 Juzz, but can recite barely any of it. In this case, most of what is considered old memorisation is actually "nearly new" or lost, because it was never made solid due to lack of revision. This is a huge waste of time.

#### How to divide the time:

##### Old memorisation:
Repeated regularly, completing over a period of days/weeks through a daily portion. If a mistake is made, clear the calander and address the mistake immediately.

##### Recent memorisation:
This one is given the most attention, presuming that the old memorisation is fine.

##### New memorisation:
If the above is fine and there is time left, then do the new memorisation.

Of course, your teacher will help you in judging when to move on. However, it is often the case that you will be a better judge than your teacher will. That is because your teacher may be soft with you, while you must honest with yourself

### Revision with peers

Note here, mudhaakara is not used the same as muraaja'ah, which would refer to self revision. 

**Mudhaakara refers to coming together with others and revising as a group**.

> Revise Hadith with your peers, so that it does not escape you (secretly), for it is not like the Qur'an which is compiled and preserved. And if you do not revise the Hadith, it will escape you. Don't let one of you say 'I have narrated yesterday, so I will not narrate today'. Rather, narrate yesterday, narrate today, and narrate tomorrow.
