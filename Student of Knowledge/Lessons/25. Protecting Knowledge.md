# The Eleventh Principle: Guarding Knowledge from the Things Which Detract From It

## Definitions

> [!Vocab] بَطَّالٌ
>  One who peddles falsehood

> [!Definition] Maru'ah
> [[Ibn Taymiyyah the grandfather]] (Majd ad-Dīn ʿAbd as-Salām ibn Taymiyyah d. 652 AH) and his grandson [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] gave the following definition:
> 
> اِسْتِعْمَالُ مَا يُجَمِّلُهُ وَيُزَيِّنُهُ 
> وَتَجَنُّبُ مَا يُدَنِّسُهُ وَيَشِينُهُ
> 
> “Using that which beautifies and adorns a person, and avoiding that which soils and tarnishes him.”

Maru'ah could be translated as **etiquette**. Not as in adab, but as in etiquette of a the people of a place, and what the people expect from you.

**Maru'ah revolves around two points:**
1. **Doing** that which will *beautify and adorn* you
2. **Keeping away** from that which will cause a person to *lose honour*

Maru'ah differs from place to place. 

## The evidence for maru'ah

> [!Quran] [[Al-A'raaf]] ([[7:199]])
> خُذِ ٱلْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِٱلْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْجَـٰهِلِينَ [١٩٩](https://quran.com/7/199)
> 
> Take what is given freely, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant.

> [!Quote] As explained by [[Sufyan ibn 'Uyayna]]
> قيل لِسُفْيَان بن عيينه: قد استنبطت من القرأن كل شَيْء فاين الْمُرُوءَة فِيهِ
> 
 فَقَالَ فِي قولة تعالي " خُذِ ٱلْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِٱلْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ ٱلْجَـٰهِلِينَ " فَفِيهِ الْمُرُوءَة وَحسن الادب وَمَكَارِم الاخلاق
> 
 >It was said to Abū Muḥammad, Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah: 
 >"You have extracted proof for everything from the Qur'an, so where is maru'ah?" 
 >
 >He said:
 >"In the statement of Allāh: 'Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish'. It contains exemplary conduct, good etiquette, and noble manners."

The word =="العُرْف"== or =="المَعْرُوف"== has two meanings here:
1. That which is good
2. That which is customary - that which is known and acceptable in society

## Things that tarnish maru'ah (Khawārim al-Muruʾah)

These can take different rulings:

**Haram**

For example listening to music.

**Makruh**

For example, drinking standing up.

**Mubah**

Examples could include:
- Eating with cutlery where eating with the hand is the social norm  
- A teacher attending a class in sports clothing  
- Being seen frequently in places that harm one’s dignity
- Speaking in 'Aamiyyah in wrong context (eg asking a question in the lesson in 'Aamiyyah).

> [!Quote] Scholars will often say regarding these things:
> لَا يَنْبَغِي لِطَالِبِ الْعِلْمِ
> 
> “It is not befitting for a student of knowledge.”

> [!Quote] [[Imam Ahmad]] said regarding khawārim al-muruʾah
> طَالِبُ الْحَدِيثِ وَلَيْسَ لَهُ وِرْدٌ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ
> 
> “A student of ḥadīth who has no portion of the night (in worship).”
