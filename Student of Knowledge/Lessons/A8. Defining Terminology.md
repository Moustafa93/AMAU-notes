# Differences in Aqeedah within ahl al-Sunnah

**In the core issues of Aqeedah, there are no differences within Ahl al-Sunnah**
	eg the Muslims will see Allah on yawm al-Qiyamah

**In the subsidiary matters / branches, there may be differences**
	eg did the Messenger ﷺ see Allah within his life?

BUT such differences in opinion are based on legitimate evidence and are not derived from deviancy in methodology or incorrect sources 

**The same can be said for Fiqh**

There are core isses, like the obligation of Salah, about which there are no differences.

And there are subsidiary matters/branches, eg the placement of the hands in the Salah, about which people differe. 

**The difference between Aqeedah and Fiqh is:**

- In Fiqh - the core matters are few, and the subsidiary matters are very many
- In Aqeedah - the core matters are many, and the subsidiary matters are few
# Ijma'ah as a Source

**The nature of ijma'ah is different in aqeedah than in fiqh**

Ijma'ah needs to be based on a daleel

In Aqeedah - the ijma'ah will typically be around one evidence. Everyone will reach one conclusion through the same path.

In fiqh - the ijma'ah may be from different evidences. Everyone will reach one conclusion through a number of paths.

**Why is this important**:

Scholars of ahl al-Sunnah may differ over some secondary evidence. That does not mean that they disagree on the core belief, nor the primary evidence, but they may differ as to whether the secondary evidence establishes the core belief.

**For example:**

There is Ijma'ah that the Muslims will see Allah on yawm al-Qiyama.

The scholars all agree that the following is an evidence for this:

> [!Quran] [[Yunus]] ([[10:26]]) 
> 
> ۞ لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا۟ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌۭ ۖ وَلَا يَرْهَقُ وُجُوهَهُمْ قَتَرٌۭ وَلَا ذِلَّةٌ ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ أَصْحَـٰبُ ٱلْجَنَّةِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـٰلِدُونَ ٢٦
> 
> For them who have done good is the best [reward] - and extra. No darkness will cover their faces, nor humiliation. Those are companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.

Specifically, they agree that { وَزِيَادَةٌۭ ۖ } refers to seeing Allah.

*So this is the primary evidence around which is agreement.*

But, it could be that a small number are of the opinion that the following ayaat are not referring to the same thing:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Qiyamah]] ([[75:22]]-23) 
> 
> وُجُوهٌۭ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ نَّاضِرَةٌ ٢٢
> Some faces, that Day, will be radiant,
> 
> إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌۭ ٢٣
> Looking at their Lord.

Thus they would differ in the secondary evidence, but agree on the core issue.

# Is the word 'Aqeedah used in the technical sense in the Quran or Sunnah?

**In general the Quran and Sunnah refer to matters of Aqeedah with the word Iman**

What of Aqeedah?

> [!hadith] Narrated [[Zayd ibn Thaabit]]
> 
> ... ==لَا يَعْتَقِدُ== قَلْبُ مُسْلِمٍ عَلَى ثَلَاثِ خِصَالٍ إِلَّا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ
> ، قَالَ : قُلْتُ : مَا هُنَّ؟،
>  قَالَ : إِخْلَاصُ الْعَمَلِ لِلَّهِ، وَالنَّصِيحَةُ لِوُلَاةِ الْأَمْرِ، وَلُزُومُ الْجَمَاعَةِ
> 
> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: There is no Muslim heart **that has the 'Aqeedah** of three attributes, except they will enter paradise.
> 
> I said: What are they?
> 
> He said: Sincerity in action, sincere advice to the those in authority, and sticking to the jama'ah.
> 
> {{ Sunan ad-Darimi 231 }}

Here, although the attributes mentioned fall under the subject matter of 'Aqeedah, the usage itself is closer to the linguistic meaning of "holding onto" or being "consistent in".

# Did early generations use the word in the technical sense?

> [!Quote] Abu Ubayd Al Qāsim ibn as-Sallam (d. 224 AH) said in his book Kitab al-Iman: 
> 
> فَعَمَلُ الْقَلْبِ: الِاعْتِقَادُ
> 
> The action of the heart is Aqeedah.

(The word "الِاعْتِقَادُ" is essentially the same as Aqeedah)

**This is closer to the technical definition, but not quite there.**

Actions of the heart are not limited to belief, even if they are based on belief, eg having hope in Allah. So the term is not used in a way the excludes what we would consider to be outside the technical usage of the term.

Also note that he named is book Kitab al-Iman not Kitab al-Aqeedah.

> [!Quote] [[Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Muhammad Al-Tahawi]] (d 321 AH) said:
> هَذَا ذِكْرُ بَيَانِ ==عَقِيدَةِ أَهْلِ السُّنَّةِ وَالْجَمَاعَةِ==، عَلَى مَذْهَبِ فُقَهَاءِ الْمِلَّةِ أَبِي حَنِيفَةَ النُّعْمَانِ بْنِ ثَابِتٍ الْكُوفِيِّ وَأَبِي يُوسُفَ يَعْقُوبَ بْنِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ الْأَنْصَارِيِّ، وَأَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ الْحَسَنِ الشَّيْبَانِيِّ. رِضْوَانُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِمْ أَجْمَعِين ==وَمَا يَعْتَقِدُونَ مِنْ أُصُولِ== الدِّينِ وَيَدِينُونَ بِهِ رَبَّ الْعَالَمِينَ
> 
> This is a mention of the **Aqidah** of Ahlus Sunnah and its people upon the madhab and fuqahā, Abu Hanifa, Abu Yusuf, Yusuf ibn Ibrahim Al Ansari, Abi Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-Hasān ash Shaybāni, May Allāh be pleased with them all, and the **Aqīdah** they held in regards to the Usūl ad Dīn
> 
> {{ [[Al-Aqeedah al-Tahawiyyah]] }}

**This was the precise technical meaning**

Others who used it in the full technical sense include:
- [[Abu Haatim al-Raazi]] (d. 327 AH)
- Hibatullah Ibn al-Hasan Ibn Mansur [[al-Lalaka'i]] (d. 418 AH)
- [[Imam al-Bayhaqi]] (Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Husayn, d. 458 AH)


# Differences in Terminology

Technical definition was not used until relatively late, and there are a number of different terminologies used.

**Is this a problem?**

Consider the following commonly quoted principle:

> [!Principle] 
> لا مُشَاحَّة في الاصطلاح
> 
> There should be no arguing over terminology

This is the default position, **but this principle is not without condition** (see below). 

**Terminology is not intended in and of itself.** 

It is the implementation of the meaning that is important. The content is the same regardless of how we label the subject.

**There is a very important condition**:

> [!Quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said
> وَالِاصْطِلَاحَاتُ لَا مُشَاحَّةَ فِيهَا إِذَا لَمْ تَتَضَمَّنْ مَفْسَدَةً
> 
> There should be no arguing over terminology so long as that that terminology  **does not lead to negative consequences**
> 
> {{[[Madaarij al-Saalikeen]]}}

For example, if you take wine and change the label to say grape juice, this is blame worthy - people may not realise what it is, or may not associate the correct ruling to it.

So if anyone ever quotes the principle "لا مُشَاحَّة في الاصطلاح", we have to consider - "is there a mafsadah in this terminology?". If the answer is yes, we do not accept it's use.
