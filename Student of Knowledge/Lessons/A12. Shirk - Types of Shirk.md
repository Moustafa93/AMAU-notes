# Division of Shirk by Ruling - Major & Minor

**Major Shirk** | شرك أكبر

This is defined by way of the same technical definition of shirk in general:
> "أن يُصرف لغير الله ما هو محق حقّ لله سبحانه وتعالى وحده في الربوبية والعبادة والأسماء والصفات"

Ruling: 
	The person does it has left Islam, and is a kaafir murtadd.

Note there is a difference between a general statement and applying the ruling on a specific person

---
**Minor Shirk** | شرك أصغر

Definition:

> "الشِّرْكُ الأَصْغَرُ هُوَ كُلُّ مَا كَانَ وَسِيلَةً إِلَى الشِّرْكِ الأَكْبَرِ، أَوْ وَرَدَ فِي النُّصُوصِ أَنَّهُ شِرْكٌ، وَلَمْ يَصِلْ إِلَى حَدِّ الشِّرْكِ الأَكْبَرِ"
> 
> "Minor shirk is anything that is a means to major shirk or is mentioned in the texts as shirk but does not reach the level of major shirk."

Example:

> [!Hadith] [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] narrated
> 
> ‏قَالَ رَجُلٌ لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏:‏ مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ وَشِئْتَ، قَالَ‏:‏ جَعَلْتَ لِلَّهِ نِدًّا، مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ‏.‏
> 
> "A man said, to the Prophet, 'Whatever Allah wills and you will.' He said, 'You have put an equal with Allah. It is what Allah alone wills.'"
> 
> Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 783

Ruling:
	Major Sin. 
	It can lead to Major shirk, but does not itself cause a person to leave Islam.

In general, minor shirk falls under two types of actions:
1. an action that leads to major shirk
2. an action described as shirk that does not have the ruling associated with it to it

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] said
> 
> لَأَنْ أَحْلِفَ باللهِ كَاذِبًا أَحَبُّ إلَيَّ مِن أَنْ أحْلِفَ بِغَيْرِ اللّهِ صَادِقًا
> 
> To swear by Allah falsely is more beloved to me than to swear by other than Allah truthfully.

(Swearing by other than Allah is minor shirk)

Generally speaking, shirk is the worst of the major sins.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4:48]]) 
> 
> إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِۦ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱفْتَرَىٰٓ إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا ٤٨
> 
> Indeed, Allāh does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allāh has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.

Some scholars said this statement applies to both minor and major shirk, but that:
- the person who dies upon major shirk will not be forgiven and will go to hell forever
- the person who dies upon minor shirk will not be forgiven but will not go to hell forever.

## Causes of minor shirk

---
1.  التَّعَلُّقُ بِبَعْضِ الْأَسْبَابِ الَّتِي لَمْ يَأْذَنْ اللَّـهُ بِهَا
**Attaching yourself to certain means that Allah has not given permission for** 
 
This accounts for the majority of minor shirk.


> [!example] 
> Attaching a black cloth to ones car to protect from the evil eye
> 
> - If you believe that the cloth protects you => **major shirk**
> - If you believe that Allah protects you through the cloth => **minor shirk**

This cause refers to seeking protection outside of:

- **Shar'i means** | الأسباب الشرعية
	- Means for protection that are mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah
	- eg: A prophetic dua for protection
	  
- **Qadari means** | الأسباب القَدَرِيَّة
	- Something that Allah has decreed as a means for protection, that is something that is plainly known and understood
	- eg: A metal shield to protect from an arrow
	- eg: Paracetamol as a cure for fever

Taking a means that does not fall into one of these two, while accepting that Allah is the one who protects through the means, is minor shirk

---
2. تَعْظِيمُ بَعْضِ الْأَشْيَاءِ التَّعْظِيمَ الَّذِي لَا يَصِلُهَا إِلَى مَقَامِ الرُّبُوبِيَّةِ
**Honouring things more than they should be honoured without reaching a level of lordship**


> [!example]
> - A person swears by his father's or mother's life.
> - Or a person says "ما شاء الله و شئت" (whatever Allah wills and you will)
>  - Or a person says "if it was not for you..."

In these examples, the person does not believe that eg their parents are deserving of lordship or worship, but they are venerating to a level that of honour that is for Allah alone.

Note - لَوْ لَا الله و فلان (if it wasn't for Allah and you) is still an example of minor shirk. Instead,  should say "لَوْ لَا الله ==ثُمَّ== فلان"

 It is through this cause that  shirk entered mankind - **going to extremes in venerating the saalihin**

## Ways to Distinguish Between Major and Minor Shirk

We can identify minor shirk through the following ways:

1. **The Messenger** ﷺ **specifically stated something is minor shirk**

> [!Hadith] [[Mahmood ibn Labid]] narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:
> قَالَ رَسُولُ اَللَّهِ ‏- صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏-{ إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَلشِّرْكُ اَلْأَصْغَرُ: اَلرِّيَاءُ
> 
> 
> “The thing I fear most for you is the lesser shirk (polytheism), showing-off (of good deeds).”
> 
> {{ Ahmad, wording as per [Bulugh Al-Muram](https://sunnah.com/urn/2054460) }}

2. **Shirk mentioned without the prefix "ال" generally refers to minor shirk**

This is not always the case. It is a general rule and not an absolute principle.

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]]:
> 
> عَنْ زَيْنَبَ، امْرَأَةِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ، قَالَ سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‏=="‏ إِنَّ الرُّقَى وَالتَّمَائِمَ وَالتِّوَلَةَ شِرْكٌ ‏"==‏ ‏.‏ قَالَتْ قُلْتُ لِمَ تَقُولُ هَذَا وَاللَّهِ لَقَدْ كَانَتْ عَيْنِي تَقْذِفُ وَكُنْتُ أَخْتَلِفُ إِلَى فُلاَنٍ الْيَهُودِيِّ يَرْقِينِي فَإِذَا رَقَانِي سَكَنَتْ ‏.‏ فَقَالَ عَبْدُ اللَّهِ إِنَّمَا ذَاكِ عَمَلُ الشَّيْطَانِ كَانَ يَنْخَسُهَا بِيَدِهِ فَإِذَا رَقَاهَا كَفَّ عَنْهَا إِنَّمَا كَانَ يَكْفِيكِ أَنْ تَقُولِي كَمَا كَانَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‏"‏ أَذْهِبِ الْبَاسَ رَبَّ النَّاسِ اشْفِ أَنْتَ الشَّافِي لاَ شِفَاءَ إِلاَّ شِفَاؤُكَ شِفَاءً لاَ يُغَادِرُ سَقَمًا ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> Zaynab, the wife of Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, told that Abdullah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) saying: **spells, charms and love-potions are polytheism.**
> 
> I asked: Why do you say this? I swear by Allah, when my eye was discharging I used to go to so-and-so, the Jew, who applied a spell to me. When he applied the spell to me, it calmed down. Abdullah said:
> 
> That was just the work of the Devil who was picking it with his hand, and when he uttered the spell on it, he desisted. All you need to do is to say as the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to say: Remove the harm, O Lord of men, and heal. Thou art the Healer. There is no remedy but Thine which leaves no disease behind.
> 
> {{ Sunan Abi Dawud 3883 }}

3. **The Sahaba understand something to be minor shirk** 

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]]:
> 
>  عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ الطِّيَرَةُ شِرْكٌ الطِّيَرَةُ شِرْكٌ ‏"‏ ‏.‏ ثَلاَثًا 
>  
>  ‏"‏ ==وَمَا مِنَّا إِلاَّ وَلَكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُذْهِبُهُ بِالتَّوَكُّلِ== ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Taking omens is polytheism; taking omens is polytheism. He said it three times. 
> 
> (Ibn Mas'ud said:) **Every one of us falls into it**, but Allah removes it by trust (in Him).
> 
> {{ Sunan Abi Dawud 3910 }}

From Ibn Mas'uds statement we understand that the shirk here is minor shirk

4. **It is described with something that indicates that it is not akbar**

> [!Hadith] [[Zaid ibn Khalid]] narrated:
> 
> عن زيد بن خالد رضي الله عنه قال‏:‏ صلى بنا رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم صلاة الصبح بالحديبية في أثر سماء كانت من الليل، فلما انصرف أقبل على الناس، فقال‏:‏ ‏"‏هل تدرون ماذا قال ربكم‏؟‏ ‏"‏ قالوا‏:‏ الله ورسوله أعلم‏.‏ قال‏:‏ قال‏:‏ ‏"‏==أصبح من عبادي مؤمن بي وكافر بي== ، فأما من قال‏:‏ مُطِرْنَا بفضل الله ورحمته، فذلك مؤمن بي كافر بالكواكب، وأما من قال‏:‏ مُطِرْنَا بنوء كذا وكذا، فذلك كافر بي مؤمن بالكواكب‏"‏ ‏(‏‏(‏متفق عليه‏)‏‏)‏‏.‏
> 
> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) led the Fajr prayer at Al-Hudaibiyyah after a rainfall during the night. At the conclusion of prayer, he turned towards the people and said, "Do you know what your Rubb has said?" 
> 
> They replied: "Allah and His Messenger know better." 
> 
> Upon this he remarked, "He has said: '**Some of My slaves have entered the morning as My believers and some as unbelievers**. He who said: We have had a rainfall due to the Grace and Mercy of Allah, believes in Me and disbelieves in the stars; and he who said: We have had a rainfall due to the rising of such and such star, disbelieves in Me and affirms his faith in the stars."'  
>   
> {{ Al-Bukhari and Muslim, wording as per Riyad al-Salhin 1731 }}  

Here, they did not believe that stars themselves sent down the rain, rather that it was a reason/means by which Allah sent down the rain.

The Prophet did not instruct them that they needed to enter Islam again/that they had committed apostasy - thus minor

# Dividing Shirk by type of Tawheed

**Shirk in worship** | شرك الألوهية
	Most common type

---
**Shirk in Lordship** | شرك الربوبية

---
**Shirk in Names and Attributes** | شرك الأسماء والصفات

---
Shirk in our time is worse than the Shirk in the time of the prophet ﷺ in 2 ways:

1. During the messenger ﷺ time, it was almost always exclusively in worship. Today, many people who claim Islam have shirk in Rububiyyah

2. Quraysh would only commit shirk in times of ease but not hardship. Today, many who claim Islam commit shirk in times of ease and hardship.

> [!Quran] [[Al-'Ankabut]] - ([[29-65]])
> 
فَإِذَا رَكِبُواْ فِى ٱلۡفُلۡكِ دَعَوُاْ ٱللَّهَ مُخۡلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّىٰهُمۡ إِلَى ٱلۡبَرِّ إِذَا هُمۡ يُشۡرِكُونَ
> 
> And when they board a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him

# Dividing Shirk by how Obvious it is

**Shirk can be obvious, open and apparent**

**Shirk can be hidden** / خفي

Examples:
- pPutting ones trust in other than Allah
- The hypocrits who conceals shirk in their hearts while portraying Iman and Tawheed in their actions

Sometimes the Messenger ﷺ would use shirk al-khafee to refer to shirk al-asghar.

But in general, **hidden shirk can be minor or major**.

The evidence of hidden shirk in the Sunnah: 

> [!Hadith] [[Muqbil ibn Yasar]]  said that he came to the Prophet (ﷺ) with [[Abu Bakr]] 
> 
>  انْطَلَقْتُ مَعَ أَبِي بَكْرٍ الصِّدِّيقِ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ إِلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم، فَقَالَ‏:‏ يَا أَبَا بَكْرٍ، لَلشِّرْكُ فِيكُمْ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ،
>  
 فَقَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ‏:‏ وَهَلِ الشِّرْكُ إِلاَّ مَنْ جَعَلَ مَعَ اللهِ إِلَهًا آخَرَ‏؟‏ 
>  
>  فَقَالَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم‏:‏ وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَلشِّرْكُ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ، أَلاَ أَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَيْءٍ إِذَا قُلْتَهُ ذَهَبَ عَنْكَ قَلِيلُهُ وَكَثِيرُهُ‏؟‏ قَالَ‏:‏ قُلِ‏:‏ اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ أُشْرِكَ بِكَ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا لا أَعْلَمُ‏.‏
> 
> He said, "O Abu Bakr, polytheism enters your people more quietly (secretly) than the movement of ants."
> 
> Abu Bakr asked, "Is there a kind of polytheism besides associating anything with Allah?" 
> 
> The Prophet (ﷺ) said," By him who has my life in his power, polytheism is more concealed than the movement of ants. Shall I not teach you something which if you say will eliminate minor or major (polytheism)?" 
> 
> He then said, "Say: O Allah! I seek refuge in you lest I associate anything with you while I know it, and I seek your forgiveness for what I do not know.’"

# Dividing Shirk by Where it Comes From

**Beliefs** | الشرك في الاعتقادات

To hold a shirki belief, even if the person never expresses it or acts upon it.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] - ([[2-165]])
> 
> وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَندَادًا يُحِبُّونَهُمۡ كَحُبِّ ٱللَّهِۖ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓاْ أَشَدُّ حُبًّا لِّلَّهِۗ وَلَوۡ يَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓاْ إِذۡ يَرَوۡنَ ٱلۡعَذَابَ أَنَّ ٱلۡقُوَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلۡعَذَابِ
> 
> And [yet], among the people are those who take other than Allah as equals [to Him]. They love them as they [should] love Allah . But those who believe are stronger in love for Allah . And if only they who have wronged would consider [that] when they see the punishment, [they will be certain] that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment.

---
**Statements** | الشرك في الأقوال
Examples:
- To express a shirki belief
- To make du'a to other than Allah

---
**Actions** | الشرك في الأعمال

Examples:
- To sacrifice to other than Allah
- To perform sajdah to other than Allah

---

**In general the three are linked** - due to shirk in 'Aqidah, the person would fall into Shirk in Statements and Actions.
