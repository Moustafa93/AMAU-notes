# Linguistic definition of the root - ع ق د

**Tying something, ie a knot** -  الرَّبطُ

eg عَقَدتُ الحَبلَةَ - I tied the rope

> [!Quran] [[Al-Falaq]] ([[113:4]])
> وَمِن شَرِّ ٱلنَّفَّـٰثَـٰتِ فِى ٱلْعُقَدِ ٤
> 
> And from the evil of the blowers in knots


**Covenant/contract** - العَهدُ

eg تَمَّ عَقدُ الزَّوَاجٍ - The marriage contract was completed

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ma'idah]] ([5:1])
>  يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ أَوْفُوا۟ بِٱلْعُقُودِ ۚ
>  
 Oh you who have believed fulfill your contracts


**Consistency and continuation. Invariability** المُلازَمَةُ

eg عَقَدَ قَلبَهُ عَلَيهِ - His heart was set on it

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nisa]] ([[4:33]])
> وَٱلَّذِينَ عَقَدَتْ أَيْمَـٰنُكُمْ فَـَٔاتُوهُمْ نَصِيبَهُمْ
> 
 And to those that your oaths have been bound, give them your share


**Emphasis** - التَّوكِيدُ

eg عَقَّدتَ المُشكِلَة - You complicated the problem

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ma'idah]] ([[5:89]])
> لَا يُؤَاخِذُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ بِٱللَّغْوِ فِىٓ أَيْمَـٰنِكُمْ وَلَـٰكِن يُؤَاخِذُكُم بِمَا عَقَّدتُّمُ ٱلْأَيْمَـٰنَ ۖ
>
> Allāh will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you [certainly] intended of oaths. 


**Others Meanings**

- Tightening - الشَّدّ
- Certainty and being sure - اليَقِينُ والجَزمُ
- Holding something together; cohesion - التَّمَاسُكُ
- Taking hold of something firmly - الأَخذُ بِالقُوَّةِ

These can all fit under the 4 primary meanings above


**Core meaning**

All these meanings fall under الرَبط - tying and being bound

Whether حِسِّي (tangible/literal) or مَعنَوِي (intangible/figurative)

# Generic technical definition of Aqeedah

In general: **the belief of any group, whether connected to Islam or not.**

## Link to linguistic root meanings

> [!NOTE] الرَبط:
> You are tied to your beliefs / you are bound by your beliefs

> [!NOTE] العهد:
>  Your beliefs are a covenant between you and Allah. 
>  eg entrance to Islam is through shahada which is a statement of belief.

> [!NOTE] المُلازَمَة:
> You should be consistent and continuous in your Aqeedah.
> Generally inconsistency in Aqeedah is a sign of deviation.

> [!NOTE] التوكيد:
> Aqeedah is a serious matter that is not to be taken lightly.

> [!NOTE] اليقين والجزم: 
> You should have certainty in your beliefs 

# Specific technical definition of Aqeedah, and it’s subject matter (الموضوع)

It is: **The specific/core beliefs of Islam, encompassing the following subject matters:**

1. **The 6 pillars of Iman**

    - This encompasses the core and majority of the subject matter of Aqeedah
    - [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] and others summarised this as saying that Aqeedah deals with "النّبُوَّة والغَيبِيَّات" - Prophethood and matters of the unseen
    
2. **The concept of Iman itself**
	
	- For example
	    - Iman increases and decreases
	    - Actions are a part of Iman

    - Why is this a part of the subject matter?
	    - Our core subject matter is the 6 pillars of Iman
	    - Because deviancy exists within this topic (eg [[al-Murji'ah]]). *This is why many topics are included in this subject.*

3. **The companions**
    
    - Why a part of the subject matter?
	    - It is a branch of النبوة
	    - Because deviancy exists within this topic (eg al-Shi’ah)

4. **The matter of rulership** (مسألة الإمامة)

    - Why a part of the subject matter?
	    - Because deviancy exists within this topic. (eg al-khawarij)


-  **Where should Aqeedah be taken from?** (مصادر تلقي العقيدة)

	- May not be counted as the fifth of the above four, but is discussed and is relevant to each of the four.

	- Why a part of the subject matter?
	    - One of the biggest differences between those with correct Aqeedah and those without is the source. eg Aql vs Naql

# Questions for the students

**Question**: How do we know that these beliefs are those are specific to Islam? Where did we get the concept from? How do we know that there are not more or fewer? Where did we get this list from?

**Question**: In some of the books of Aqeedah, you sometimes find matters of Fiqh. Eg “from the Aqeedah of ahl al sunnah is wiping over the leather socks”.
