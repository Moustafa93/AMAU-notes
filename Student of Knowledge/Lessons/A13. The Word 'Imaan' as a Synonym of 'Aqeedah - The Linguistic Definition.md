# Linguistic definition of Iman

**Summary**: Iman = الإِقرَارُ (affirmation)

> Believing in the truth of something, and affirming that belief by acting on it with conviction.

## According to the dictionaries

The majority of dictionaries define Iman as "تَصدِيق" - believing something to be true

This is not problematic in and of itself - but it used by some groups of innovation to **remove actions from Iman**.

The response by ahl al-Sunnah was not only in through the Quran and sunnah, but also in terms of the linguistic definition of Iman.

**It is still the case that the majority of the scholars and ahl al-sunnah said  "Iman means Tasdeeq"**, but would say that the shar'iah defined it with actions. This is fine, but misses the linguistic subtly as which is itself a response to the people of innovation.

To say that Iman means tasdeeq is fine, but to say that tasdeeq is the complete picture of Iman, is incorrect linguistically.

## Tasdeeq and something more

> [!quote] The great scholar of language [[al-Raghib al-Isfahani]] said:
> 
> 
> وقال الراغب الأصفهاني: آمن إنما يقال على وجهين:
>  أحدهما: متعدّيًا بنفسه، يقال: آمنته، أي جعلت له الأمن ومنه قيل لله مؤمن.
>   والثاني: غير متعدٍّ، ومعناه صار ذا أمن.
>    وقوله تعالى: ﴿وَمَا أَنْتَ بِمُؤْمِنٍ لَنَا وَلَوْ كُنَّا صَادِقِينَ﴾ ، قيل: معناه بمصدق لنا،==إلا أن الإيمان هو التصديق الذي معه أمن==

> "Āman" (to believe) is used in two ways: as a transitive verb, it is said "Āmantuhu" (I made him secure), meaning I provided him with security. From this, Allah is called "Al-Mu'min - The bestower of security." As an intransitive verb, it means to become secure.
> 
> In the verse: "And you will not believe us, even if we are truthful" ([[Yusuf]] - [[12:17]]), it was said its meaning is,"you don’t believe us even though we are telling the truth". **But it is a belief in something to be true that is accompanied by conviction/security** (feeling safe in that belief).

> [!Quote] [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] said:
> 
> وَمَعْلُومٌ أَنَّ الْإِيمَانَ هُوَ الْإِقْرَارُ؛ لَا مُجَرَّدُ التَّصْدِيقِ.
> 
> It is known that faith (iman) is affirmation, not just mere belief.
> 
>  وَالْإِقْرَارُ ضِمْنَ قَوْلِ الْقَلْبِ الَّذِي هُوَ التَّصْدِيقُ وَعَمَلِ الْقَلْبِ الَّذِي هُوَ الِانْقِيَادُ
> 
> Affirmation includes the statement of the heart, which is belief, and the action of the heart, which is submission.

In both the above quotes, Iman is defined as tasdeeq and **something extra**:
- [[al-Raghib al-Isfahani]] - security/safety in the belief | الأَمَنُ
- [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] - affirmation of the bleif | الْإِقْرَارُ

Note that الْإِقْرَارُ (affirmation) includes:
- belief (statement of the heart)
- submission (action of the heart)

> For this reason, interpreting iman as affirmation (iqrar) is more accurate (as was the view of [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]). We would then say: iman is affirmation, and there is no affirmation without belief (so tasdeeq is still there). One would say "aqarra bihi" (he affirmed it), just as one would say "amana bihi" (he believed in it), or "aqarra lahu" (he affirmed to him), just as one would say amana lahu . 
> 
> This pertains to the linguistic definition.

In summary "Tasdeeq" is not interchangeable linguistically or grammatically with Iman. But Iqrar (which entails tasdeeq) is.

Notice how the shaykh joins between the views of [[al-Raghib al-Isfahani]] and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]. Iman contains the word الأَمَنُ, and is closer to the word الْإِقْرَارُ.

## Iman means الْإِقْرَارُ

The summary of the discussion is that Iman means الْإِقْرَارُ, and this includes tasdeeq.

Where الْإِقْرَارُ means:
	believing it is true, and then acting on that belief with conviction, by submitting your heart to it

# What is the purpose of this discussion?

Why discuss this? **Actions are a fundamental part of Iman**.

التَّصْدِيقُ لَا يَنْفَعُهُ وَحْدَهُ بَلْ لَابُدَّ مَعَهُ مِنَ اَلانْقِيَادِ وَالِاسْتِسْلَامِ وَهُوَ مَا يُسَمَّى بِعَمَلِ الْقَلْبِ وَيَلْزَمُ مِنْ ذَٰلِكَ قَوْلُ اللِّسَانِ وَعَمَلُ الْجَوَارِحِ وَهَذِهِ الْأَجْزَاءُ مُتَرَابِطَةٌ لَا غِنَى لِبَعْضِهَا عَنْ بَعْضٍ.

**Just having belief in the truth of something does not benefit by itself.** Rather, a person has to **submit to that belief** and **act according to it**. It (Submitting to a belief & Acting according to it) is what the scholars call **actions of the heart**. From the Actions of the Heart comes the Statements of the tongue and the Actions of the limbs. And all these parts are interdependent and connected to one other
