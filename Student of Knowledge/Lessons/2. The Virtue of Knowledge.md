# The virtues of knowledge

> [!question]  Why is it important to know the virtue of something before studying it?
> 1. ***Motivation*** → Allows you to endure the hardship in pursuing that goal
> 2. ***Sincerity*** → The virtues we consider are virtues in the sight of Allah. Thus we lose concern for the worldly benefits.

## We were created to worship Allah alone based on Knowing Allah

This is the greatest of virtues.

>> [!quran] ﴾ Quran al-Dhariat 51:56 ﴿
>>  وَمَا خَلَقْتُ ٱلْجِنَّ وَٱلْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ ٥٦
>>
>> I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me.
>
>> [!Notes] 
>> We were only created for worship
>> 
>> You cannot worship Allah without knowledge.

> [!col]
>>[!quran] ﴾ Quran al-Talaq 65:12 ﴿ 
>>ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـٰوَٰتٍۢ وَمِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ ٱلْأَمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِتَعْلَمُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌۭ وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمًۢا ١٢
>>
>>Allah is the One Who created seven heavens ˹in layers˺, and likewise for the earth. The ˹divine˺ command descends between them so you may know that Allah is Most Capable of everything and that Allah certainly encompasses all things in ˹His˺ knowledge.
> 
>> [!Notes] 
>> The universe was only created to know Allah.
>> 

There is **no contradiction** between the two verses above, because knowing Allah leads you to worship Him alone, and you cannot worship Him alone if you do not know Him.


> [!attention] .
> The more you know Allah, the more you will worship Him and the stronger your worship will be,

## Virtues from the virtues of knowledge

This is a non exhaustive list.

### 1. Allah mentioned the testimony of the people of knowledge along side His testimony and the testimony of the Angles

> [!col]
>>[!quran] ﴾ Quran Ali Imran 3:18 ﴿
>>شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلْمَلَـٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمِ قَآئِمًۢا بِٱلْقِسْطِ ۚ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ١٨
>>
>>Allah ˹Himself˺ is a Witness that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—and so are the angels and people of knowledge. He is the Maintainer of justice. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—the Almighty, All-Wise.
>
>> [!Notes] 
>> The people of knowledge (& no one else form bani Adam) were included in such a virtuous context
>> 
>> It is their knowledge that entitles them to make testimony; their yaqeen in it makes them worthy for this.
>> 
>> The testimony of the ignorant could be true, however it is not based on yaqeen and so it is not as worthy.

### 2. Knowledge causes a person to be raised in rank and status   

>[!col]
>>[!quran] **[﴾ Quran Al-Mujadila 58:11  ﴿](http://Quran.com/58:11)**
>>  يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُوا۟ فِى ٱلْمَجَـٰلِسِ فَٱفْسَحُوا۟ يَفْسَحِ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۖ وَإِذَا قِيلَ ٱنشُزُوا۟ فَٱنشُزُوا۟ يَرْفَعِ ٱللَّهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ مِنكُمْ وَٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ دَرَجَـٰتٍۢ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌۭ ١١   
>>
>>O believers! When you are told to make room in gatherings, then do so. Allah will make room for you ˹in His grace˺. And if you are told to rise, then do so. Allah will elevate those of you who are faithful, and ˹raise˺ those gifted with knowledge in rank. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.
>
>>[!notes]
>>The person of knowledge is not raised up by the people, but they are raised up by Allah   

### 3. Knowledge is from the easiest of the paths to Jannah 

> [!col]
>>[!HADITH] **[⧼ Hadith Abi Dardaa’ in Ibn Majah⧽](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:223)**
>> مَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَلْتَمِسُ فِيهِ عِلْمًا سَهَّلَ اللَّهُ لَهُ طَرِيقًا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَإِنَّ الْمَلاَئِكَةَ لَتَضَعُ أَجْنِحَتَهَا رِضًا لِطَالِبِ الْعِلْمِ وَإِنَّ طَالِبَ الْعِلْمِ يَسْتَغْفِرُ لَهُ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاءِ وَالأَرْضِ حَتَّى الْحِيتَانِ فِي الْمَاءِ وَإِنَّ فَضْلَ الْعَالِمِ عَلَى الْعَابِدِ كَفَضْلِ الْقَمَرِ عَلَى سَائِرِ الْكَوَاكِبِ إِنَّ الْعُلَمَاءَ هُمْ وَرَثَةُ الأَنْبِيَاءِ إِنَّ الأَنْبِيَاءَ لَمْ يُوَرِّثُوا دِينَارًا وَلاَ دِرْهَمًا إِنَّمَا وَرَّثُوا الْعِلْمَ فَمَنْ أَخَذَهُ أَخَذَ بِحَظٍّ وَافِرٍ ‏"‏ ‏.‏   
>> 
>>  “Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, Allāh will make easy for them a path to paradise. The angels lower their wings in approval of the seeker of knowledge. Verily, that which is in the heavens and earth seeks forgiveness for the scholars even the fish in the sea. The virtue of a scholar over a worshipper is similar to the virtue of the moon over the remaining stairs on a night when it is full [the moon]. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, and the Prophets leave neither dinar nor dirham, leaving only knowledge, and he who takes it takes an abundant portion”   
  *This wording in Sunan ibn Majah 223. Also Musnad Ahmad 21715, Sunan Abī Dāwūd 3641, Sunan al-Tirmidhī 2682. It is Hasan due to supporting evidence.*

>>> [!Bio] [[**Abu Darda**]] (d32 AH)   
>>> Sahabi.
>>> 
>>> His name was:
>>> ‏عامر/ ‏عويمر
>>> الانصاري
>>> الخزرجي -  (one of the two tribes of the Ansar) ‏   
>>
>>> [!notes]
>>> *This Hadith is also discussed further in shaykh ARH class:* [[6. Importance of Seeking Knowledge]]   

### 4. The angles lower their wings for the student of knowledge   

### 5. Seeking knowledge is a reason for everything in the heavens and the earth to ask for your forgiveness   

### 6. The virtue of the scholar over the worshiper is like the virtue of the moon on the night when it is full over all other heavenly bodies.   

Note that this is the virtue of the ‘Aalim over the ‘Aabid, not the ‘Aalim over the Faasiq   

> [!question] Why does the ‘Aalim have virtue over the ‘Aabid?
> - The scholar is able to fulfil that worship properly with khushu’ that only comes with knowledge   
> - The scholar is able to be of benefit to others   

### 7. The scholars are the inheritors of the prophets.   
  
*(The proof for the above 5 virtues is the aforementioned Hadith of Abi Darda)*   
### 8. The only people who truly fear Allah are the people of knowledge   

> [!col]
>>[!quran] ﴾ **[Quran Faatir 35:28](http://www.quran.com/35:28)** ﴿   
>> وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَٱلدَّوَآبِّ وَٱلْأَنْعَـٰمِ مُخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَٰنُهُۥ كَذَٰلِكَ ۗ إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى ٱللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ ٱلْعُلَمَـٰٓؤُا۟ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ غَفُورٌ ٢٨ 
>> 
>>   just as people, living beings, and cattle are of various colours as well. Of all of Allah’s servants, only the knowledgeable ˹of His might˺ are ˹truly˺ in awe of Him. Allah is indeed Almighty, All-Forgiving.    
> 
>> 

### 9. Allah specifically commanded the Prophet to ask for more knowledge   

> [!col]
>>[!quran] ﴾ **[Quran Taha 20:114](http://www.quran.com/20:114)** ﴿   
>>  فَتَعَـٰلَى ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱلْحَقُّ ۗ وَلَا تَعْجَلْ بِٱلْقُرْءَانِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يُقْضَىٰٓ إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُۥ ۖ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْمًۭا ١١٤
>> 
>> Exalted is Allah, the True King! Do not rush to recite ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran ˹O Prophet˺ before it is ˹properly˺ conveyed to you,1 and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”   
> 
>> 


### 10. Having knowledge is a sign that Allah wants good for you  

> [!col]
>>[!HADITH] **[⧼ Hadith Muawiya in Bukhari ⧽](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:71)** 
>>مَنْ يُرِدِ اللَّهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّينِ، وَإِنَّمَا أَنَا قَاسِمٌ وَاللَّهُ يُعْطِي، وَلَنْ تَزَالَ هَذِهِ الأُمَّةُ قَائِمَةً عَلَى أَمْرِ اللَّهِ لاَ يَضُرُّهُمْ مَنْ خَالَفَهُمْ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ ‏"‏‏.‏
>>
>>  I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "If Allah wants to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion. I am just a distributor, but the grant is from Allah. (And remember) that this nation (true Muslims) will keep on following Allah's teachings strictly and they will not be harmed by any one going on a different path till Allah's order (Day of Judgment) is established."

# The Advice of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib to Kumayl ibn Ziyad   

>[!QUOTE] Kumayl ibn Ziyad said:
> أخذ علي بن أبي طالب بيدي فأخرجني إلى ناحية الجبان ، فلما أصحرنا جلس ، ثم تنفس ، ثم قال 
>  
>يا كميل بن زياد ، القلوب أوعية ، فخيرها أوعاها ، احفظ ما أقول لك : الناس ثلاثة : فعالم رباني ، ومتعلم على سبيل نجاة ، وهمج رعاع أتباع كل ناعق ، يميلون مع كل ريح ، لم يستضيئوا بنور العلم ، ولم يلجئوا إلى ركن وثيق ، العلم خير من المال ، العلم يحرسك وأنت تحرس المال ، العلم يزكو على العمل والمال تنقصه النفقة ، ومحبة العالم دين يدان بها ، العلم يكسب العالم الطاعة في حياته ، وجميل الأحدوثة بعد موته ، وصنيعة المال تزول بزواله ، مات خزان الأموال وهم أحياء ، والعلماء باقون ما بقي الدهر ، أعيانهم مفقودة ، وأمثالهم في القلوب موجودة ، هاه ، إن هاهنا - وأشار بيده إلى صدره - علما لو أصبت له حملة ، بلى أصبته لقنا غير مأمون عليه . يستعمل آلة الدين للدنيا ، يستظهر بحجج الله على كتابه ، وبنعمه على عباده ، أو منقادا لأهل الحق لا بصيرة له في إحيائه ، يقتدح الشك في قلبه بأول عارض من شبهة ، لا ذا ولا ذاك ، أو منهوم باللذات ، سلس القياد للشهوات ، أو مغرى بجمع الأموال والادخار ، وليسا من دعاة الدين ، أقرب شبها بهما الأنعام السائمة ، كذلك يموت العلم بموت حامليه ، اللهم بلى لا تخلو الأرض من قائم لله بحجة ؛ لئلا تبطل حجج الله وبيناته ، أولئك هم الأقلون عددا ، الأعظمون عند الله قدرا ، بهم يدفع الله عن حججه حتى يؤدوها إلى نظرائهم ، ويزرعوها في قلوب أشباههم ، هجم بهم العلم على حقيقة الأمر ، فاستلانوا ما استوعر منه المترفون ، وأنسوا بما استوحش منه الجاهلون ، صحبوا الدنيا بأبدان أرواحها معلقة بالمنظر الأعلى ، أولئك خلفاء الله في بلاده ، ودعاته إلى دينه ، هاه هاه شوقا إلى رؤيتهم ، وأستغفر الله لي ولك ، إذا شئت فقم.

>   "O Kumayl ibn Ziyad! The hearts are receptacles, so the best of them is the one which preserves the best. So memorise what I say to you. 
>   
>   "The people are of three (types):  
>   - the Scholar who is *rabbani*,    
>   - the one learning being upon the path of salvation,   
>   - and the confused rabble who follow everyone who calls out - bending along with every wind - they are not enlightened by the light of knowledge, nor do they lean upon a firm support.   
>    
>   "Knowledge is better than wealth. Knowledge is a protection for you, whereas it is you that has to protect wealth. The *zakat* of knowledge is action, whereas spending decreases wealth. And love of the Scholar is part of the Religion. Knowledge brings about obedience for the Scholar in his own lifetime and causes him to have good repute after his death, whereas the benefit of wealth ceases when it passes away. The hoarders of wealth have died even though they are still alive, whereas the Scholars remain for as long as time remains - their persons are lost, but their examples remain in the hearts.   
>   
>   "Here, indeed here - (and he pointed to his chest) - there is knowledge, if only I could find carriers for it. But instead I have found them quick to comprehend, but not trustworthy. They use what pertains to the Religion for worldly ends. They seek to use Allah's proofs against His Book, blindly following the people of truth, but having no insight regarding receiving it.   
>   
>   "Doubt pierces their hearts when anything problematic arises. They are neither this nor that. They do not know where the truth lies, and if they are mistaken then they do not know why. They are ardently in love with something the true state of which they do not know - so they become a trial for others.   
>   
>   "And indeed, the utmost good is for the one to whom Allah grants understanding of the Religion And it is enough ignorance for a person that he does not know about his Religion. Such a person is passionately addicted to pleasures, accustomed to following desires, or is one given to amassing wealth and piling it up. Such people are not from the callers to the Religion rather they are more like the grazing cattle. And thus knowledge passes away with the passing away of those who carry it.   
>   
>   "Oh Allah, yes! The earth will not be without one who stands upright for Allah, with proof - so that Allah's proofs and clear signs are not abolished. They are the ones who are few in number, but having the most value to Allah. With them, Allah asserts His proofs amongst their contemporaries and cultivates them in the hearts of those similar to them. With them, knowledge assaults and comes upon the true state of affairs, so that which those accustomed to easy living find difficult therein, they find easy; and they are at home with that which causes consternation to the ignorant ones. They live in this world with their bodies, whereas their souls are attached to higher things. They are Allah's ambassadors in His land and the callers to His Religion. Oh how I would like to see them, and I seek Allah's forgiveness for myself and for you. If you wish then you may leave."
