# The Nineteenth Principle: Having a Passion for Knowledge and It Being Uppermost in Your Heart 

Sidq in knowledge requires loving it and finding pleasure in it.

Pleasure of knowledge is gained by three things:

1. Giving your best and utmost effort.  
      
2. Truthfulness in seeking it.  
      
3. Correctness of intention and sincerity.

To achieve these three things, we mus repel that which opposes them.

# The Twentieth Principle: Making Good Use of Your Time in Seeking Knowledge

From the examples given are those scholars of the past who
- Would not waste even an hour of ones time
- Would listen to knowledge even when eating or using the bathroom
- Taking and teaching many lessons
- Reading many books
- Studying under many teachers

> [!quran] [[Fatir]] ([[35:37]]) 
> 
> وَهُمْ يَصْطَرِخُونَ فِيهَا رَبَّنَآ أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَـٰلِحًا غَيْرَ ٱلَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ ۚ أَوَلَمْ نُعَمِّرْكُم مَّا يَتَذَكَّرُ فِيهِ مَن تَذَكَّرَ وَجَآءَكُمُ ٱلنَّذِيرُ ۖ فَذُوقُوا۟ فَمَا لِلظَّـٰلِمِينَ مِن نَّصِيرٍ ٣٧
> 
> And they will cry out therein, "Our Lord, remove us; we will do righteousness - other than what we were doing!" But did We not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember, and the warner had come to you? So taste [the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper.

# Conclusion

The shaykh includes the following quote that effectively summarises the book, and what the student should aspire to be:

> [!Quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]]
> طالب النفوذ إلى الله والدار الاخرة -بل وإلى كل علم وصناعة ورئاسة بحيث يكون رأسا في ذلك مقتدى به فيه- يحتاج أن يكون شجاعا، مقداما، حاكما على وهمه، غير مقهور تحت سلطان تخيله، زاهدا في كل ما سوى مطلوبه، عاشقا لما توجه إليه، عارفا بطريق الوصول إليه والطرق القواطع عنه، مقدام الهمة، ثابت الجأش، لا يثنيه عن مطلوبه لوم لائم ولا عذل عاذل، كثير السكون، دائم الفكر، غير مائل مع لذة المدح ولا ألم الذم، قائما بما يحتاج إليه من أسباب معونته، لا تستفزه المعارضات، شعاره الصبر، وراحته التعب، محبا لمكارم الأخلاق، حافظا لوقته، لا يخالط الناس إلا على حذر كالطائر الذي يلتقط الحب بينهم، قائما على نفسه بالرغبة والرهبة، طامعا في نتائج الاختصاص على بني جنسه، غير مرسل شيئا من حواسه عبثا، ولا مسرحا خواطره في مراتب الكون.وملاك ذلك هجر العوائد وقطع العلائق الحائلة بينك وبين المطلوب.
> 
> The one who seeks to go through to Allāh and the Hereafter, or in fact to any knowledge, craft, and position, such that he becomes a leader in that and others follow him in it; he needs to be brave and valiant; one who is in control of his ideas, not subjugated to his whims; abstaining from everything besides his objective, passionate about that which will direct him towards it; knowing the path that will lead him to it and the paths which will cut him off from it; bold in aspiration; unagitated, such that no one blaming or criticising him can divert him from his goal; a person of much tranquillity; always thinking; not inclined to the pleasure of praise,  of exhaustion; loving noble manners; guarding his time; he does not mix with people except with caution, like the bird who snatches a seed from among them; maintaining himself in a state of hope and fear; wishing for the results of his choice to specialise beyond what others do; not using any of his senses pointlessly; nor allowing his mind to wander through the levels of the universe - and the core of all of this is to abandon what people usually do and the connection with things that come between you and your objective.
