# The Seventh Principle: Taking the Initiative to Attain Knowledge, and Taking Advantage of Childhood and Youth

Race and rush towards good deeds

Evidences:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] [2:148](https://quran.com/2:148)
> فَٱسْتَبِقُوا۟ ٱلْخَيْرَٰتِ ۚ
> 
> So race to [all that is] good

> [!Quran] [[Al-Hadid]] [57:21](https://quran.com/57:21)
>  سَابِقُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍۢ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ ٱلسَّمَآءِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ أُعِدَّتْ لِلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ ٱللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ ذُو ٱلْفَضْلِ ٱلْعَظِيمِ ٢١
>  
>  Race [i.e., compete] toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth, prepared for those who believed in Allāh and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allāh which He gives to whom He wills, and Allāh is the possessor of great bounty.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Nisa]] [[4:123]]
> لَّيْسَ بِأَمَانِيِّكُمْ وَلَآ أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ ۗ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوٓءًۭا يُجْزَ بِهِۦ وَلَا يَجِدْ لَهُۥ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيًّۭا وَلَا نَصِيرًۭا ١٢٣
> 
> It [i.e., Paradise] is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides Allāh a protector or a helper.
> 
> https://quran.com/4:123/

> [!Poem] And as the poet said:
> 
> إِذَا تَمَنَّيْتُ بِتُّ لَيْلِيَ مُغْتَبِطًا ... إِنَّ الْمُنَى رَأْسُ أَمْوَالِ الْمُفَالِيسِ
> 
> When I wish, I spend the night in joy,
> ... For dreams are the capital of the bankrupt.

People fall into depression because of false hopes and wishful thinking. High aspirations are not wishful thinking, but they must be accompanied by determination (‘azīmah), hard work, and reliance upon Allah (tawakkul).


> [!Poem] As the poet said:
> وَلَسْتُ بِمُدْرِكٍ مَا فَاتَ مِنِّي ... بِلَهْفٍ وَلَا بِلَيْتَ وَلَا لَوْ أَنِّي
> 
> I cannot regain what has passed from me
> ... By saying “if only,” “I wish,” or “had I.”

A student of knowledge is in one of two states: 
- seeking knowledge while reducing distractions - they will reach their goal in sha Allah
- surrendering to distractions - the will not reach their goal
 
Everyone has distractions, we must minimize them. To reach the lofty goal, we must even give up some permissible things.

The main obstacle to seeking knowledge when older is not being older in and of itself, but the distractions that come with the responsibilities of age.

The takeaway: if you are younger - take advantage of your youth. And if you are older - manage your commitments well and strive to minimize distractions as much as possible.

# The Eighth Principle: Adhering to Being Unhurried in Seeking Knowledge and Leaving off Rushing

Knowledge is heavy, proof:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Muazzammil]] [[73:5]]
> إِنَّا سَنُلْقِى عَلَيْكَ قَوْلًۭا ثَقِيلًا [٥](https://quran.com/73:5)
> 
> Indeed, We will cast upon you a heavy word.

And this is the description of a Quran that has been made easy

> [!Quran] [[Al-Qamar]] ([[54:17]])
> وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْءَانَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍۢ [١٧](https://quran.com/54:17)
> 
> And We have certainly made the Qur’ān easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember? 

So if the Quran is made easy, then what of the other forms of knowledge?

> [!Quran] [[Al-Furqan]] ([[25:32]])
>  وَقَالَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لَوْلَا نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ جُمْلَةًۭ وَٰحِدَةًۭ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ لِنُثَبِّتَ بِهِۦ فُؤَادَكَ ۖ وَرَتَّلْنَـٰهُ تَرْتِيلًۭا [٣٢](https://quran.com/25:32)
> 
> And those who disbelieve say, "Why was the Qur’ān not revealed to him all at once?" Thus [it is] that We may strengthen thereby your heart. And We have spaced it distinctly.[1]

This ayah is a proof to sticking to being unhurried in seeking knowledge, taking it in stages, and leaving off rushing as [[al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] mentioned in his book [[Al-Faqih wal-Mutafaqqih]].

> [!Poetry] From the poetry of Ibn an-Nahhaas al-Halabi:
> الْيَوْمَ شَيْءٌ وَغَدًا مِثْلُهُ ... مِن نُخَبِ الْعِلْمِ الَّتِي تُلْتَقَطُ
> 
> يُحَصِّلُ الْمَرْءُ بِهَا حِكْمَةً ... وَإِنَّمَا السَّيْلُ اجْتِمَاعُ النُّقَطِ
> 
> Today something, and tomorrow something like it,
> ... From the choicest knowledge that is gradually collected.
> 
> Through it a person attains wisdom,
> ... For a torrent is nothing but a gathering of drops.

> [!Quote] [[Shu'bah ibn al-Hajjaj]] said:
> اخْتَلَفْتُ إِلَىٰ عَمْرِو بْنِ دِينَارٍ خَمْسَ مِائَةِ مَرَّةٍ، و مَا سَمِعْتُ مِنْهُ إِلَّا مِائَةَ حَدِيثٍ، فِي كُلِّ خَمْسَةِ مَجَالِسَ حَدِيثٌ
> 
> I went to ‘Amr ibn Dīnār five hundred times, and I only heard one hundred hadith from him—one hadith every five sittings.

> [!Quote] Ḥammād ibn Abī Sulaymān said to a student:
> تَعَلَّمْ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ ثَلَاثَ مَسَائِلَ وَلَا تَزِدْ عَلَيْهَا شَيْئًا
> 
> Every day, learn three issues and do not add to them anything.


> [!Quote]
> Whoever embarks upon looking at the larger works [ie before they are ready] has transgressed against his religion, and has gone beyond the moderate way of knowledge, and this may well lead to him being lost

And this is why you see beginner students saying they are drowning in ikhtilaf and do not know what to do. And this principle too falls under al-tadarruj.
