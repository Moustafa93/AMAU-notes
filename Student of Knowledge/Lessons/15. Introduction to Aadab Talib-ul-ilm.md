# Definition of the title "آداب طالب العلم"

## The meaning of "آداب"
(Plural of أَدَب)

### The original Meaning

The word originally referred to the banquet, as can be understood by the meaning of two variations of the word:

1.  **The one who invites someone else to a banquet** | the آدِب

> [!Quote] From the poetry of [[Tarfa ibn al-'Abd]] (d 569 CE, pre-Islamic Poet)
> نحن في المشتاة ندعو الجفلى ... لا ترى الآدب فينا ينتقر
> 
> In winter, we invite the common people ... you do not see the 'Aadib' among us being selective

2.  **The banquet to which people are invited** | the مَأْدُبَة

### In the Early Islamic Era

In the Islamic era, it came to mean "**good manners**" (الأخلاق الحسنة) and "having a **noble disposition**" (الطبع الكريم)

> [!Hadith] In the weak Hadith, the Prophet SAW was reported to have said:
> أدبني ربي فأحسن تأديبي
> 
> My Lord taught manners to me, and he did so in the most excellent way

The narration is not known to have an authentic chain, but it is quoted to show the use of the word to mean good manners.

> [!Quote] From the poetry of [[Sahm ibn Handhara al-Ghanawi]] 
> لَا يمْنَع الناسُ منّي مَا أرَدْتُ وَلَا ... أُعطِيهُمُ مَا أَرَادوا حسن ذَا أدبا
> 
> People do not prevent me from that which I want while I ... do not give them what the want - what excellent ettiquete

There are different explanations about the context of this line of poetry, but it could be said that he was rebuking himself sarcastically, saying "How can it be that the people give to me but I do not give to them".

> [!Bio] [[Sahm ibn Handhara al-Ghanawi]]
> A tabi'i mukhadram (مُخَضْرَم)- lived at the time of the Prophet, but did not meet him

### The Ummayad Era

In the time of the Umayyads and early Abbasids,  it was used for **manners** and **education**. 

We can see this from the following books:

1. al-Adab al-Saghir and al-Adab al-Kabir by [[Abdullah ibn Muqafa]] (d. 142 AH)
 
> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn Muqafa]] said in his introduction to al-Adab al-Saghir
> وَقَدْ وَضَعْتُ فِي هَذَا الْكِتَابِ مِنْ كَلاَمِ النَّاسِ الْمَحْفُوظِ حُرُوفًا فِيهَا عَوْنٌ عَلَى عِمَارَةِ الْقُلُوبِ وَصِقَالِهَا وَتَجْلِيَةِ أَبْصَارِهَا، وَإِحْيَاءٌ لِلتَّفْكِيرِ، وَإِقَامَةٌ لِلتَّدْبِيرِ، وَدَلِيلٌ عَلَى مَحَامِدِ الْأُمُورِ وَمَكَارِمِ الْأَخْلاَقِ إِنْ شَاءَ الله
> 
>  I've placed in this book, from the speech of the people preserved in writing, that which will aid the heart to be built up and polished, and will refine their insight, and bring life and thought, and to establish reflection, and a guide to praiseworthy matters and **noble manners**.

1. In the anthology Diwan al-Hamasa by [[Abu Tammam Habib ibn Aws at Ta'i]] (d 231 AH), which had a chapter titled "Bab al-Adab"

2.  [[Imam al Bukhari]] included a chapter of Adab in his Saheeh

### Meaning in later times

After the 2nd and 3rd centuries AH, it became used in a restricted sense to mean the **poetry of the Arabs and their history**, or what may be called **Arabic literature**.

- al Kamil fi al-Lughah wa al-Adab by [[al-Mubarrid]] (Muhammad ibn Yazid - d. 285 AH)
- Adab al-Kaatib by [[Ibn Qutayba]] (d. 276 AH)
- al-Aqd al-Farid by Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abd Rabih (d. 328 AH)

## The meaning of "طالب العلم"

To seek or pursue (something) | طَلَبَ

The use of طالب to refer to seeking or pursuing علم is found in several ahadith:
 
> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Anas ibn Maalik]]
> 
>  قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم
>  
>  ‏"‏ مَنْ خَرَجَ فِي ==طَلَبِ الْعِلْمِ== فَهُوَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ ‏"
> 
> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: "Whoever goes out seeking knowledge, then he is in Allah's cause until he returns."
> 
> { Sunan al-Tirmidhī 2647 }

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abu Dardaa']]
> 
> سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ
> 
 ‏ "‏ مَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا ==يَطْلُبُ فِيهِ عِلْمًا== سَلَكَ اللَّهُ بِهِ طَرِيقًا مِنْ طُرُقِ الْجَنَّةِ وَإِنَّ الْمَلاَئِكَةَ لَتَضَعُ أَجْنِحَتَهَا رِضًا لِطَالِبِ الْعِلْمِ..."‏ 
> 
> I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: If anyone travels on a road in search of knowledge, Allah will cause him to travel on one of the roads of Paradise. The angels will lower their wings in their great pleasure with one who seeks knowledge...

**Who is the Taalib al-'Ilm**?

Linguistically: anyone who is seeking or pursuing knowledge.

**And knowledge is something that you never finish seeking**, as Allah commanded the Prophet SAW:

> [!Quran] [[Ta-Ha]] ([[20-114]])
>  وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْمًۭا ١١٤
> 
> and say, "My Lord, increase me in knowledge."

Here, knowledge is only the knowledge of the Shari'ah, not worldly subjects. 

**Allah blames those who seek knowledge of the dunya and don't know about the religion:**

> [!Quran] [[al-Rum]] ([[30-7]])
> يَعْلَمُونَ ظَـٰهِرًۭا مِّنَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ غَـٰفِلُونَ ٧
> 
> They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they, of the Hereafter, are unaware.

### Categories of طالب العلم

1. **The beginner**  (المبتدئ)
	- Has begun on the path, but does not have the foundations of knowledge
	- Generally not what طالب العلم means in the unrestricted sense

2. **The intermediate** (المتوسط)
	- Knows the fundamentals, but can not deduce rulings from evidences
	- ==Generally what طالب العلم means in the unrestricted sense==
	
3. **The advanced** / the final level  (المنتهي)
	- Knows the fundamentals and can deduce rulings from evidences
	- Generally what would  be considered a ==scholar== or ==mujtahid==

In the general linguistic sense, all three would fall under the term طالب العلم, but in the specific unrestricted sense طالب العلم would usually refer to category 2.

Of course, terminology may be used in different ways and changes over time. Today, the term scholar is often freely used for those in the second category.

Sometimes, طالب العلم will be contrasted to the word عَامِّيّ (pl. عَوَامّ - regular person from among the common folk)

**In the past, memorising the Quran was considered a prerequisite** to being a طالب العلم, and someone who memorised the Quran would still be considered from the عَوَامّ.

## Compound Definition of "ادب طالب العلم"

> [!Definition] ادب طالب العلم
>  The manners and etiquette of the person seeking knowledge of the religion. 

This includes the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels.

**This subject also often extends to the methodology of seeking knowledge.**

This is because the way that learn the religion will be influenced by your general approach, which will be influenced by your manners and etiquette.

For example, from the methodology of seeking knowledge is seeking knowledge in stages. And this is rooted in having a deep respect for knowledge, considering it something weighty and valuable that cannot be obtained quickly and haphazardly. 

**Aadaab => behaviour => methodology** 

Having the right aadaab results in the right methodology, and so starting with this topic will help the student reach the goal more quickly and efficiently.

**From another angle, we could say that Allahs tawfiq will only be given to those who have the correct behaviours and etiquette.**

So there are many reasons why this subject should be learned, and why it should be studied early in the curriculum. 

Like any subject, it has levels from beginner to advanced.

**If you find that you are not progressing, then going back through a course or book on the subject may be the solution.**

# Books on the subject

Most of these books have not been translated, and some are at an advanced level. It will take time until they are all approachable. But **it is of benefit to have a list of the important books in a subject for future reference**.

- [[Kitab al-'Ilm]] - [[Abu Khaythamah]] Zuhair Ibn Harb (d. 234 AH)
- Akhlaq Hamalat al-Quran by [[Imam al-Aajurri]] (Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn al-Husayn, d. 360 AH)
- [[Akhlaq al-'Ulama]] by [[Imam al-Aajurri]]

- [[Al-Jami' li Akhlaq ar-Rawi]] - [[al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]]( ★★★)
- [[Iqtidaa al-'Ilm wal-'Amal]] by [[al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]]
- [[Jaami' Bayaan al-'Ilm wa Fadlih]] - [[Ibn 'Abd al-Barr]](Yusuf ibn Abdillah - d. 463H) (★★)
- Ta'lim al-Muta'allim Turraaq at-Ta'lim by Burhanuddin [[Al-Zarnuji]] (d. 591 AH)

**Priority books to read from the above list are marked with stars.** The more stars, the higher priority.

One approach could be to start with those that translated into English, and later on to strive to read the two "Jami'"s by [[al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] and [[Ibn Abd al-Barr]]
