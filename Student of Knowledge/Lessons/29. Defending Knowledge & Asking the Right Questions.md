# The Seventeenth Principle: Defending Knowledge and Preventing It From Attack

Defending knowledge takes several forms:

1. Refuting the one who opposes it
	- By the right person (scholars), in the right way.
	
2. Forsaking the innovator

3. Rebuking the student who shows very poor manners.

# The Eighteenth Principle: Showing Restraint When Asking the Scholars Questions

There are four fundamental principles for asking questions:

## 1. Asking for the right reason

The intention should be to gain knowledge.

Not to be stubborn, show off, or fish for an answer

## 2. Ask about the right thing

To avoid asking something that is of no benefit, or hypothetical questions, or ambiguous questions

## 3. Ask in the right circumstance

Do not ask the shaykh when he is not ready to answer questions.

>> ie. it is not an appropriate time to ask

## 4. Ask in the right way

Begin with a supplication for the shaykh, and honour him in the way in which you address him
