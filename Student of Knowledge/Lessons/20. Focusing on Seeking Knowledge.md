# The third Principle - Focusing all of ones attention on seeking knowledge

Requires three things from a person:
1. To direct themselves towards knowledge
2. To have himmah (aspiration) and irādah (willpower)
3. To not preoccupy themselves with anything else

## What of those who are part time?

How do we reconcile this principle with part time study?


> [!Hadith] Hadith of [[Omar ibn al-Khattab]]
> فَقَالَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ وَجَارٌ لِي مِنَ الأَنْصَارِ فِي بَنِي أُمَيَّةَ بْنِ زَيْدٍ، وَهْىَ مِنْ عَوَالِي الْمَدِينَةِ، وَكُنَّا نَتَنَاوَبُ النُّزُولَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَيَنْزِلُ يَوْمًا وَأَنْزِلُ يَوْمًا، فَإِذَا نَزَلْتُ جِئْتُهُ مِنْ خَبَرِ ذَلِكَ الْيَوْمِ مِنَ الأَمْرِ وَغَيْرِهِ، وَإِذَا نَزَلَ فَعَلَ مِثْلَهُ
> 
> Then ‘Umar went on relating the narration and said. "I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet ﷺ in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me.
> 
> { [Sahih al-Bukhari 2468](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:2468) }

It is rare that someone has nothing else to do than seek knowledge.

What matters here is the focus of the attention.

There is a difference between a person who works and wastes his free time, and the one who works while minimising the time spent working, and spending all available time in knowledge. 

### The example of [[Haafidh al-Hakami]]
[[Haafidh al-Hakami]]was a shepherd, and used to look after his mothers sheep along with his brother. His mother did not give him permission to go out and seek knowledge. And so, he would send his brother go out and learn something, and come back to teach him about it, or to bring him a book to read while he worked. 

This continued until one of the shuyukh saw he was intelligent and gifted, and tried to convince his mother to let him go out to study, even offering to pay for a shepherd. She refused, but in the end they agreed upon one day a week. 

He became one of the great scholars of his time.

It is not the case that you have nothing else to do, but where is your passion? Where are your aspirations?

If your goal, attention and ambition are on seeking knowledge, then all of the dunya is like using the bathroom - it is something necessary that you will do but not something that occupies your mind or that you spend excessive time in.

## How to focus ones attention on a goal

Requires three things

### 1. A keenness for what benefits

Such that whenever you have the opportunity, you seize it.

This requires knowing what is beneficial. Even in knowledge there is that which is beneficial and that which is not.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] ([2:200-201](https://quran.com/2/200-201)) 
> فَإِذَا قَضَيْتُم مَّنَـٰسِكَكُمْ فَٱذْكُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ كَذِكْرِكُمْ ءَابَآءَكُمْ أَوْ أَشَدَّ ذِكْرًۭا ۗ فَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا وَمَا لَهُۥ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ مِنْ خَلَـٰقٍۢ ٢٠٠
> 
> And when you have completed your rites, remember Allāh like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with [much] greater remembrance. And among the people is he who says, "Our Lord, give us in this world," and he will have in the Hereafter no share.
> 
> وَمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا فِى ٱلدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةًۭ وَفِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ حَسَنَةًۭ وَقِنَا عَذَابَ ٱلنَّارِ ٢٠١
> 
> But among them is he who says, "Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire."

[[Ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] mentioned that the first group are the people that have no desire for the Aakhirah

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ruum]] ([30:7](https://quran.com/30/7)) 
> يَعْلَمُونَ ظَـٰهِرًۭا مِّنَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ عَنِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ غَـٰفِلُونَ ٧
> 
> They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they, of the Hereafter, are unaware.

> [!quote] [[Al-Hassan al-Basri]] said about this ayah
> By Allah, you will find one of them has reached such a stage in the worldly life, that he can balance a dirham on his finger and tell you the precise weight of it, and he doesn't know how to pray

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] said about this ayah: 
> The kuffar know all about the life of this world, but they are ignorant when it comes to the religion

### 2. Seeking the help of Allah

A person must balance between striving hard and seeking the help from Allah
### 3. Not being helpless in reaching the desired goal

A person should never feel helpless.

Helplessness comes from two places:
1. Loosing hope
2. Leaving actions

So a person must combine between hope of reaching ones goal with the actions that a required to reach it.

Evidence for the three things:

> [!Hadith] Narrated by [[Abu Hurayrah]]
> الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ وَفِي كُلٍّ خَيْرٌ 
> 
> **احْرِصْ عَلَى مَا يَنْفَعُكَ وَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْجِزْ**
> 
>  فَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ شَىْءٌ فَلاَ تَقُلْ لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَذَا وَكَذَا ‏.‏ وَلَكِنْ قُلْ قَدَّرَ اللَّهُ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ فَإِنَّ ‏"‏ لَوْ ‏"‏ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَانِ
> 
> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. 
> **Strive for that which will benefit you, 
> seek the help of Allah, 
> and do not feel helpless.** 
> If anything befalls you, do not say, "if only I had done such and such" rather say "Qaddara Allahu wa ma sha'a fa'ala (Allah has decreed and whatever he wills, He does)." For (saying) 'If' opens (the door) to the deeds of Satan.'
> 
> { [Sunan Ibn Majah 79](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:79) }

From the benefits of knowledge:
 
> [!Quote]
> every good in this world and the next is the fruit of knowledge

From the ways to increase ones aspirations is to learn of the aspiration and dedication of those from the past. 

Your feet should be on the ground (you are grounded and humble, not deluded and arrogant), but your aspirations should be in the cloud.
