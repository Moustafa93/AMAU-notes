# The Twelfth Principle: Choosing Righteous Company for Seeking Knowledge

## Better off alone?

A Person may think "surely I can achieve more on my own", but in fact, a positive companion helps you to study more than you would other wise be able to, as together they can:
- revise
- go over notes
- help one another in memorization
- compete in a positive manner

**The condition of such companionship is that it is free from corruption.**

Examples of corruption in the companionship of students of knowledge:
- Mujāmalah (excessive flattery or false praise)
- Lack of naṣīḥah

## Evidence for choosing good companions

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abu Hurayrah]]:
> الرَّجُلُ عَلَى دِينِ خَلِيلِهِ فَلْيَنْظُرْ أَحَدُكُمْ مَنْ يُخَالِلُ
> 
> The Prophet (ﷺ) said: A man follows the religion of his close friend; so each one should consider whom he makes his friend.
> 
[> Sunan Abi Dawud 4833](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4833)

> [!Definition] Khalil
> The highest level of companionship:
> 
> كمال المحبة
> Absolute love

## The Three Types of Friendship

1. Friendship based on the **religion**
	- Where the two friends are looking for something virtuous in the religion
2. Friendship based upon **worldly benefit** 
	- eg you work together
	- This type of friendship should be had to the extend that it is needed
	- *Should be reduced*
3. Friendship based upon **enjoyment only**, with no benefit in the religion and no benefit in the worldly life.
	- *Should be eliminated*

## Judging a Person by His Companions

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] said:
> 
> اعتبروا الرَّجلَ بمن يُصَاحِبُ
> فإنما يُصَاحِبُ الرَّجلُ من هو مثله
> 
> “Judge a person by the one he accompanies,
> For a person only accompanies one who is like himself.”
