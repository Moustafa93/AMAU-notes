# أقسام التوحيد

**Where does this discussion fit in?**

Recall from [[14. Student's Methodology with Books]], where the format of the madakhil was discussed, category 10 (Masaa'il) included "An overview of some individual mas'aail". This is where this lesson fits in

**Why do we categorise things**?

1. To make it easy understand - تَقريب الفهم

2. To clarify when people do something wrong. 
	
	If left vague, it is easy for someone to claim Tawheed because they come with  a part of it. Categorisation makes it clear that there is another part that they have not come with
	
3. The categorisation is derived from the Quran and Sunnah


Some scholars divided Tawheed into two categories, and others divided into three. These categorisations do not contradict.
# Dividing Tawheed into Two Categories

## 1. Tawheed of knowledge and affirmation | توحيد المعرفة والإثبات

**Can also be called:**
Tawheed of knowledge | التوحيد العلمي
Tawheed of Allah in his actions | توحيد الله بأفعاله

The essence of this category is knowing Allah and believing in Allah, including His names, attributes and actions.

So what is required from you here is knowledge and affirmation/beleif

## 2. Tawheed of intention and seeking | توحيد القصد والطلب

**Can also be called:**
Tawheed of action | التوحيد العملي
Tawheed  of worship | توحيد العبادة
Tawheed of your object of worship / divinity | توحيد الإلهية
Tawheed of worship | توحيد الألوهية
Tawheed of Allah in the actions of His servants | توحيد الله بأفعال العباد

The essence of this category is that all of ones worship is to Allah alone, such that the person:
- Does not supplicate to anyone but Allah
- Does not seek help from anyone but Allah in those things that Allah alone can do
- Does not sacrifice to other than Allah
- Does not have the love/hope/fear that is only for Allah for anyone else

## Connection between the categories

**The first category leads to the second category:**

knowledge of Allah necessitates that you worship him

**And the second category encompasses the first:**

A person cannot worship Allah alone without knowing Him and affirming that He is the only one who does what He dose

**The second category is the reason why the Prophets were sent.** 

Most people accepted the first category. That is not to say that people were perfect in knowing Allah - if they were, they would have come with the second category also. But the primary reason behind their clash with the Prophets was their contention with worshipping Allah alone.

> [!quran] [[Al-Nahl]] ([[16:36]]) 
> 
> وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍۢ رَّسُولًا أَنِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ وَٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ ٱلطَّـٰغُوتَ ۖ فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ هَدَى ٱللَّهُ وَمِنْهُم مَّنْ حَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةُ ۚ فَسِيرُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ فَٱنظُرُوا۟ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـٰقِبَةُ ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ ٣٦
> 
> And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], "Worship Allāh and avoid ṭāghūt." And among them were those whom Allāh guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed [i.e., travel] through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.

> [!Quran] [[Yusuf]] ([[12:106]]) 
> 
> وَمَا يُؤْمِنُ أَكْثَرُهُم بِٱللَّهِ إِلَّا وَهُم مُّشْرِكُونَ ١٠٦
> 
> And most of them believe not in Allāh except while they associate others with Him.

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] Commented on this ayah:
> 
> قال ابن عباس : من إيمانهم ، إذا قيل لهم : من خلق السموات ؟ ومن خلق الأرض ؟ ومن خلق الجبال ؟ قالوا :  " الله "، وهم مشركون به
> 
> Their Iman (belief they had) when it’s said to them, who created the heavens, and who created the earth, and who created the mountains? They say Allah, but they make partners with him in worship

> [!Quote] [[Ikrimah]], the great student of [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]], said:
> 
> تسألهم: مَن خلقهم؟ ومن خلق السماوات والأرض؟ فيقولون: الله. فذلك إيمانهم بالله، وهم يعبدون غيره
> You ask them: Who created them? And who created the heavens and the earth? They say: Allah. That/this is their faith in Allah, while they worship others besides Him

Ikrimah specifies they had the belief Allah is the creator, but not the belief Allah deserves to be worshiped alone.

**Here is the benefit of this categorisation** - to see that a person made a mistake in part of tawheed while believing in a part of it

# Dividing Tawheed into Three Categories

1. **Tawheed of lordship** | توحيد الربوبية 

This encompasses all aspects of the Lordship of Allah - He is the creator, giver of life, taker of life and so on

2. **Tawheed of Allahs names and attributes** | توحيد الأسماء والصفات

This is the belief that all of the perfect names and  attributes of Allah are only for Him alone.

3. **Tawheed of worship** | توحيد الألوهية

This is the same as explained in the two-categories approach
# Three Categories vs Two Categories

In reality, these are the same.

The first category of the 2 categories maps to the first and second category of the 3 categories. ie Tawheed of Lordship and Names/Attributes both require knowledge and affirmation.

# Evidence for these categories

These categories are derived through Istiqraa' of the Quran and Sunnah

They can be found throughout the Quran, in every place that Allah talks about His Oneness or Uniqueness - everything will fall into one of these categories, and nothing will fall outside of them into an additional categor.

For example:

> [!quran] [[Maryam]] ([[19:65]]) 
> 
> ==رَّبُّ== ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا ==فَٱعْبُدْهُ== وَٱصْطَبِرْ لِعِبَـٰدَتِهِۦ ۚ ==هَلْ تَعْلَمُ لَهُۥ سَمِيًّۭا== ٦٥
> 
> **Lord of the heavens and the earth** and whatever is between them - so **worship Him** and have patience for His worship. **Do you know of any similarity to Him (in names and attributes)**?"

> [!Quran] [[Al-Fatiha]]
> الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
> 
> الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ
> 
> مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ
> 
> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ

Note, {{ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ }} alone contains all three categories
1. Lordship - رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
2. Names - Allah and Rab
3. Worship - الْحَمْدُ (act of worship) & لِلَّهِ (Allah means the one who deserves worship)

Or the two categories
1. Knowing Allah - Allah,  رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
2. Worship - الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ

So this division is found even in the first Ayah of the Quran.

Looking at the remaining verses:
1. Lordship - مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ
2. Names and Attributes - الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ / مَالِكِ
3. Worship - إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ

There is no additional category - The same is true of any passage of the Quran that discusses Allah and his Tawheed.

> [!Quran] [[Al-A'raaf]] ([[7:180]]) 
> 
> ==وَلِلَّهِ ٱلْأَسْمَآءُ ٱلْحُسْنَىٰ فَٱدْعُوهُ بِهَا ۖ== وَذَرُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِىٓ أَسْمَـٰٓئِهِۦ ۚ سَيُجْزَوْنَ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَعْمَلُونَ ١٨٠
> 
> And to Allāh belong the best names, so invoke Him by them. And leave [the company of] those who practice deviation concerning His names. They will be recompensed for what they have been doing.

# Examples of Early Scholars Dividing Tawheed

> [!quote] [[Imam Abu Hanifa]] said
> والله تعالى يُدعَى من أَعلَى لا من أَسفَل لأن الأَسفَل ليس من وَصفِ الربوبية والألوهية في شيء
> 
> Allah, the Exalted, is invoked from above, not from below, because being below is not an attribute of lordship or divinity in any way

This refutes those who claim that this terminology was invented by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]].

> [!Quran] [[Surah Muhammad]] ([[47:19]]) 
> 
> فَٱعْلَمْ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنۢبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَـٰتِ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مُتَقَلَّبَكُمْ وَمَثْوَىٰكُمْ ١٩
> 
> So know, [O Muḥammad], that there is no deity except Allāh and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women. And Allāh knows of your movement and your resting place.

> [!Quote] [[Ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] said in commentary of this ayah:
> فاعلم يا محمد أنه لا معبود تنبغي أو تصلح له ==الألوهة==، ويجوز لك وللخلق عبادته، إلا الله الذي هو خالق الخلق، ومالك كل شيء، يدين له ==بالربوبية== كل ما دونه
> 
> Know Oh Muhammad, there is no object of worship that is befitting to have Uluhiyyah in (to worship it) and that it is permissible for you and permissible for creation to worship them except Allah the One who is the creator of creation and sovereign of everything and the one that everything other than him submits to his Rububiyyah (lordship) .

> [!Quote] [[Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Muhammad Al-Tahawi]] said, narrating the belief of [[Imam Abu Hanifa]], [[Abu Yusuf]] Yaqoob ibn Ibrahim al-Ansari (d 182 AH), and [[Muhammad ibn Hassan al-Shaybaani]] (d 189 AH):
> 
> هذا ذكر بيان عقيدة أهل السنة والجماعة على مذهب فقهاء الملة أبي حنيفة النعمان بن ثابت الكوفي، وأبي يوسف يعقوب بن إبراهيم الأنصاري، وأبي عبدالله محمد بن الحسن الشيباني رضوان الله عليهم أجمعين، وما يعتقدون من أصول الدين ويدينون به رب العالمين. نقول في توحيد الله معتقدين بتوفيق الله: إن الله واحد لا شريك له، ولا شيء مثله، ولا شيء يعجزه، ولا إله غيره.
> 
> This is a declaration of the ‘Aqeedah (belief) of the people of the Sunnah and the community according to the school of the jurists of the religion: Abu Hanifa al-Nu'man ibn Thabit al-Kufi, Abu Yusuf Ya'qub ibn Ibrahim al-Ansari, and Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, may Allah be pleased with them all, and what they believe in the Usul ad-din (fundamentals of the religion) and that which they worshipped the Lord of the worlds. We say about the Tawheed of Allah (monotheism of Allah), we hold this as our ‘aqeedah by the success of Allah : **Indeed, Allah is one without any partner, nothing is like Him, nothing can overwhelm Him, and there is no deity other than Him**.

He mentions three types of Tawheed:
1. Allah is one without partner (Lordship)
2. There is nothing like Him (Names and attributes)
3. There is no object of worship besides Him (Uluhiyyah)

Note also that he used the word Aqeedah, Usul al-Din and Tawheed to mean the same thing

# Guided Reading

Ustadh mentions that he plans to do a guided reading on a book on the topic.

Sh [[Abd al-Razzaaq al-Badr]] wrote a refutation of those who reject the division of Tawheed titled - [القول السديد في الرد على من أنكر تقسيم التوحيد](http://iswy.co/e14vpi)

He later summarised it in the smaller book  [المختصر المفيد في بيان دلائل أقسام التوحيد](http://iswy.co/e14vpl), which Ustadh plans on reading with us.
