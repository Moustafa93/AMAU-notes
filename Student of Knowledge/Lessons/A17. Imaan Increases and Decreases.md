This lesson can be summarised in the following important satements:

| How the Salaf would described Iman:               |                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Iman varies in quality (between people)           | الإِيمَانُ يَتَفَاضَلُ        |
| Iman increases and decreases (in a single person) | الإِيمَانُ يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ |
| Iman can be broken into parts                     | الإِيمَانُ يَتَجَزَّأُ        |

# Proof Iman varies in quality | الإِيمَانُ يَتَفَاضَلُ

> [!hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] narrates that the Prophet ﷺ said
> 
> ==الإِيمَانُ بِضْعٌ وَسَبْعُونَ أَوْ بِضْعٌ وَسِتُّونَ شُعْبَةً==
>  ==فَأَفْضَلُهَا== قَوْلُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ ==وَأَدْنَاهَا== إِمَاطَةُ الأَذَى عَنِ الطَّرِيقِ وَالْحَيَاءُ شُعْبَةٌ مِنَ الإِيمَانِ
> 
> Faith has over seventy branches or over sixty **branches**,
>> Proves الإِيمَانُ يَتَجَزَّأُ
>
> **the most excellent of which** is the declaration that there is no god but Allah, **and the lowest of which** is the, removal of what is injurious from the path: and modesty is a branch of faith.
>> Proves "الإِيمَانُ يَتَفَاضَلُ"
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 35b }}

Also note: the best of Iman is an action of the tongue (قَوْلُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ), the lowest is an action of the limbs (removal of a harmful object from the road), and modesty is an action of the heart

This is a very comprehensive hadith on the topic of Iman. From it's benefits are:
1. Iman has parts
2. Iman varies in quality
3. Iman is قول وعمل

 
> [!Quote] Letter of [['Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz]] (d 101 AH) to [[Adiyy ibn Adiyy]] (d 120 AH)
> 
> إِنَّ لِلْإِيمَانِ فَرَائِضَ وَشَرَائِعَ وَحُدُودًا وَسُنَنًا فَمَنْ اسْتَكْمَلَهَا اسْتَكْمَلَ الْإِيمَانَ وَمَنْ لَمْ يَسْتَكْمِلْهَا لَمْ يَسْتَكْمِلْ الْإِيمَانَ
> 
> Imaan has obligations, laws, limits and recommendations. Whoever completes them has completed Iman, and whoever does not complete them has not completed Iman

It is clear from this statement that Iman:
- Has divisions | يَتَجَزَّأُ
- Varies in quality | يَتَفَاضَلُ
- Increases and decreases | يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ

> [!bio] [['Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz]] ibn Marwan ibn al-Hakam
> d 101 AH
> 
> He is often called the 5fth rightly caliph. 
> 
> Of course, in reality there are 4 rightly guided caliphs, and [[Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan]] was the beginning of kingship.
> 
> And the khilafah of [[Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan]] felt to the people different to the rashidun khilafah, and felt more like kingship.
> 
> While the khilafah of [['Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz]] reminded the people of the the khilafah of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali.
> 
> **Important point in Aqeedah**: there is no doubt that [[Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan]] as a person was better than [['Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz]], because he is a Sahabi, and the Sahaba are better than those who come after them.

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mubarak]] (d 181 AH)
> 
> الْإِيمَانُ قَوْلٌ وَعَمَلٌ، وَالْإِيمَانُ يَتَفَاضَلُ
> 
> Iman is statements and actions, and some of Iman is better than others 

# Proof Iman increases & decreases | الإِيمَانُ يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ

## In the Qur'an

**The following ayatayn are a clear proof that Iman increases and decreases in a single person:**

> [!quran] [[Al-Tawbah]] ([[9-124]] to 125) 
> 
> وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌۭ فَمِنْهُم مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـٰذِهِۦٓ إِيمَـٰنًۭا ۚ فَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـٰنًۭا وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ ١٢٤
> 
> And whenever a sūrah is revealed, there are among them [i.e., the hypocrites] those who say, "Which of you has this increased in faith?" As for those who believed, it has increased them in faith, while they are rejoicing.
> 
> [[Al-Tawbah]] ([[9-125]]) 
> 
> وَأَمَّا ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌۭ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَىٰ رِجْسِهِمْ وَمَاتُوا۟ وَهُمْ كَـٰفِرُونَ ١٢٥
> 
> But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it has [only] increased them in evil [in addition] to their evil. And they will have died while they are disbelievers.

**The following ayaat all prove that Imaan can increase in a single person:**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Anfal]] ([[8-2]]) 
> 
> إِنَّمَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ ٱللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ وَإِذَا تُلِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـٰتُهُۥ ==زَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـٰنًۭا== وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ ٢
> 
> The believers are only those who, when Allāh is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely -

> [!quran] [[Aal 'Imran]] ([[3-173]]) 
> 
> ٱلَّذِينَ قَالَ لَهُمُ ٱلنَّاسُ إِنَّ ٱلنَّاسَ قَدْ جَمَعُوا۟ لَكُمْ فَٱخْشَوْهُمْ ==فَزَادَهُمْ إِيمَـٰنًۭا== وَقَالُوا۟ حَسْبُنَا ٱللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ ٱلْوَكِيلُ ١٧٣
> 
> Those to whom people [i.e., hypocrites] said, "Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them." But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, "Sufficient for us is Allāh, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs."

> [!Quran] [[Al-Muddaththir]] ([[74-31]]) 
> 
> وَمَا جَعَلْنَآ أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ إِلَّا مَلَـٰٓئِكَةًۭ ۙ وَمَا جَعَلْنَا عِدَّتَهُمْ إِلَّا فِتْنَةًۭ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ لِيَسْتَيْقِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ ==وَيَزْدَادَ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِيمَـٰنًۭا ۙ== وَلَا يَرْتَابَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۙ وَلِيَقُولَ ٱلَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌۭ وَٱلْكَـٰفِرُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ ٱللَّهُ بِهَـٰذَا مَثَلًۭا ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ يُضِلُّ ٱللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ ۚ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ جُنُودَ رَبِّكَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ وَمَا هِىَ إِلَّا ذِكْرَىٰ لِلْبَشَرِ ٣١
> 
> And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels. And We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve - that those who were given the Scripture will be convinced and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] and the disbelievers will say, "What does Allāh intend by this as an example?" Thus does Allāh send astray whom He wills and guide whom He wills. And none knows the soldiers of your Lord except Him. And it [i.e., mention of the Fire] is not but a reminder to humanity.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ahzab]] ([[33-22]]) 
> 
> وَلَمَّا رَءَا ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ ٱلْأَحْزَابَ قَالُوا۟ هَـٰذَا مَا وَعَدَنَا ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ وَصَدَقَ ٱللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُۥ ۚ ==وَمَا زَادَهُمْ إِلَّآ إِيمَـٰنًۭا وَتَسْلِيمًۭا== ٢٢
> 
> And when the believers saw the companies, they said, "This is what Allāh and His Messenger had promised us, and Allāh and His Messenger spoke the truth." And it increased them only in faith and acceptance.

Note: Sometimes Iman is used alongside an action (eg submission here). **This does not mean that action is not a part of Iman.**

**This a common feature of Arabic**, where the general and specific can be mentioned together, and this does not imply separation of the specific from the general.

Examples include:

> [!quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] ([[2-98]]) 
> 
> مَن كَانَ عَدُوًّۭا لِّلَّهِ وَمَلَـٰٓئِكَتِهِۦ وَرُسُلِهِۦ وَجِبْرِيلَ وَمِيكَىٰلَ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَدُوٌّۭ لِّلْكَـٰفِرِينَ ٩٨
> 
> Whoever is an enemy to Allāh and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allāh is an enemy to the disbelievers.

Jibril and Miikaal are mentioned along side the angels, and yet they are angels..

> [!quran] [[Al-Fatiha]] ([[1-5]]) 
> 
> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ ٥
> 
> It is You we worship and You we ask for help.

Asking for help is mentioned alongside worship, and yet asking for help is worship.

## In the Sunnah

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Sa'eed al Khudri]] narrates that the Prophet ﷺ said
>
>مَا رَأَيْتُ مِنْ ==نَاقِصَاتِ عَقْلٍ وَدِينٍ== أَذْهَبَ لِلُبِّ الرجل الحازم من إحداكن ...
>
> Among women who are deficient in intelligence and religion I have not seen anyone more able to remove the understanding of a prudent man than one of you ...
>
>{{ Bukhari and Muslim }}
 
The shaahid here is deficiency in Deen, implying decrease in Iman

> [!hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:
> 
> لاَ يَزْنِي الزَّانِي حِينَ يَزْنِي وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ وَلاَ يَسْرِقُ حِينَ يَسْرِقُ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ وَلاَ يَشْرَبُ الْخَمْرَ حِينَ يَشْرَبُهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ وَالتَّوْبَةُ مَعْرُوضَةٌ بَعْدُ
> 
> A fornicator who fornicates is not a believer as long as he commits fornication, and no one who steals is a believer as long as he commits theft, and no one who drinks wine is a believer as long as he drinks it, and repentance may be accepted after that.
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 57f }}

 When a person commits zinna, their iman decreases.

(This Hadith is mentioned often, so it is worth memorising.)

## Staements of the Companions

> [!quote] [[Omar ibn al-Khattab]]
> 
> هَلُمُّوا نَزْدَادُ الإِيمَانَ
> or:
> تَعَالَوْا نَزْدَادُ إِيمَانًا
> 
> Come along, let us increase in Imaan

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]]
> 
> اجْلِسُوا بِنَا نَزْدَادُ إِيمَانًا
> 
> Sit with us let us increase in Imaan

> [!quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] used to say in du'a:
> 
> أللهمَّا زِدنِي إِيمَاناً ويَقِيناً وفِقهاً
> 
> Oh Allah increase me in Imaan, certainty and understanding

> [!Quote] [['Umayr ibn Habib ibn Khumasha]] (from those who gave bay'a of ridwan, under the tree) said
> 
> قَالَ: الْإِيمَانُ يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ،
>  فَقِيلَ: وَمَا زِيَادَتُهُ وَنُقْصَانُهُ؟
>   قَالَ: إِذَا ذَكَرْنَا اللَّهَ وَحَمِدْنَاهُ وَسَبَّحْنَاهُ، فَذَلِكَ زِيَادَتُهُ، وَإِذَا غَفَلْنَا وَضَيَّعْنَا وَنَسِينَا، فَذَلِكَ نُقْصَانُهُ
>   
>   "Faith increases and decreases." 
>   It was said: "What causes its increase and decrease?" 
>   He said: "When we remember Allah and praise Him and glorify Him, that is its increase. And when we are heedless, neglectful, and forgetful, that is its decrease.”

## Statements of the Imams

> [!quote] Imam [[Al-Awzaa'i]]
> 
> الْإِيمَانُ قَوْلٌ وَعَمَلٌ، يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ فَمَنْ زَعَمَ أَنَّ الْإِيمَانَ يَزِيدُ وَلَا يَنْقُصُ فَاحْذَرُوهُ، فَإِنَّهُ مُبْتَدِعٌ
> 
> Imān is words and actions; it increases and decreases. So, whoever claims that Imān increases but does not decrease, beware of him, for he is an innovator

> [!quote] [['Uqbah ibn 'Alqamah]] asked Imam [[Al-Awzaa'i]] about Iman
> 
> سَأَلْتُ الْأَوْزَاعِيَّ عَنِ الْإِيمَانِ، أَيَزِيدُ؟
>  قَالَ: نَعَمْ حَتَّى يَكُونَ كَالْجِبَالِ،
>   قُلْتُ: فَيَنْقُصُ؟
>    قَالَ: نَعَمْ، حَتَّى لَا يَبْقَى مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ،
> 
>  I asked Al-Awza'i about Imān. Does it increase?' He said: 'Yes, until it becomes like mountains.' I said: 'Does it decrease?' He said: 'Yes, until nothing of it remains.'

> [!quote] [[Sufyan al-Thawri]] (Sufyan ibn Sa'eed ibn Masrooq al-Thawri, d 161 AH) said:
> 
> إِنَّ الإِيمَانَ يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ
> 
> Imān goes up and down

> [!Quote] [[Sufyan ibn 'Uyayna]] al-Kufi (d 198 AH) said
> يَقُولُ: «الإِيمَانُ يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ»
>  فَقَالَ لَهُ أَخُوهُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ بْنُ عُيَيْنَةَ: يَا أَبَا مُحَمَّدٍ، لَا تَقُولَنَّ: يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ،
>   فَغَضِبَ، وَقَالَ: «اسْكُتْ يَا صَبِيُّ، بَلْ يَنْقُصُ حَتَّى لَا يَبْقَى مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ»
> 
> "Imān increases and decreases."
>  
> His brother, Ibrahim ibn 'Uyaynah, said to him: 'O Abu Muhammad, do not say: increases and decreases.' [as if to say it goes up, don’t say it goes down]
>  He became angry and said: 'Be quiet, O boy, for it decreases until nothing of it remains.'”

> [!quote] [[Imam Al-Shafi'i]]
> الإيمان قول وعمل ويزيد وينقص
> 
> Imān is statements and actions, it goes up and down

**Whoever says this statement, and understands it properly, has been saved from being from amongst the murji'**

> [!quote] [[Abd al-Razzaaq al-San'aani]] (d 211 AH, great Imam of Hadith) said:
> 
> كَانَ مَعْمَرٌ وَابْنُ جُرَيْجٍ وَالثَّوْرِيُّ وَمَالِكٌ وَابْنُ عُيَيْنَةَ يَقُولُونَ: «الْإِيمَانُ قَوْلٌ وَعَمَلٌ يَزِيدُ وَيَنْقُصُ»
> 
> Ma’mar, Ibn Jurayj, Thawi, Malik and 'Ibn Uyaynah all said Imaan is speech and actions, it increases and decreases
> 
>> And in another narration he says "وَأَنَا أَقُولُ ذَلِكَ | and I also say this"

As such, it seems what is narrates from Mālik that it only goes up, is either it’s not true or he changed his opinion and matched the Ijma’.

> I met more than a thousand men from the scholars in the different cities, and I did not see any of them differing in that Imān is words and actions; it increases and decreases.

# The difference between the Murji' and those who made mistakes

It is true that some of the Imams of ahl al-Sunnah made mistakes in this topic.

For example, [[Imam Abu Hanifa]] and [[Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Muhammad Al-Tahawi]]. We do not say that they were from the Murji'.

It is true some of the Imāms of Ahlul Sunnah made mistakes in this true, such as Imam Abu Hanifah (150 AH) who said Imān does not increase nor decrease, which was rejected by all of the Salaf and opposes the Quran, Sunnah, and Ijma’ā, and he didn’t reach the correct view. He was not murj'ia. He was from the Murjiatul Fuqaha, the scholars of Fiqh who made this mistake. Sincere person who made a mistake. Different to the person who takes it as their Aqeedah, and deliberately opposes the Quran and Sunnah.

There are narrations of Imām Mālik saying Imān goes up but not down, but there are other narrations where he affirms both of them.


we mentioned there is an exception for the great scholars of Islām who made a mistake in this issue, such as Abu Hanifa, Tahawi, and we ask Allah to forgive them and us for that mistake.

We do not say they are Murji' Mubtad'i, but that they fell into some of what the Murji' fell into, while they were searching for the truth.
