# The Thirteenth Principle: Making an Effort in Memorisation, Revision, and Asking Questions

Taking knowledge on board requires three fundamental things:
## 1. Memorisation

**This is a private effort with oneself**

This is where the student should spend the **majority of their time**.

> [!Poem] The Shaykh quoted the following line of poetry:
> 
> ليس بعلمٍ ما حوى القِمطر ... ما العلمُ إلا ما حواه الصدر
> 
> “Knowledge is not what is carried in book satchels.
> 
> Knowledge is only what is contained in the chest.”

What is important is **small, regular, daily memorisation**. This will result in a large amount memorised with time.

**Two issues that harm memorisation:**
- Not having a regular habit of memorisation, and failing to train oneself
- Wanting to see the results to quickly, so a person jumps from book to book

## 2. Revision

**This is done with your peers** 

The word here is mudhākarah (revision with peers) — different from mudārasa (revision between the teacher and the student).

**Benefits of revising together**:
1. Competing in memorisation
2. Helping one another understand

**Evidence for revision**

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Ibn 'Umar]]:
> إِنَّمَا مَثَلُ صَاحِبِ الْقُرْآنِ كَمَثَلِ صَاحِبِ الإِبِلِ الْمُعَقَّلَةِ إِنْ عَاهَدَ عَلَيْهَا أَمْسَكَهَا وَإِنْ أَطْلَقَهَا ذَهَبَتْ
> 
> Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The example of the person who knows the Qur'an by heart is like the owner of tied camels. If he keeps them tied, he will control them, but if he releases them, they will run away."
> 
> { [Bukhari 5031](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:5031) }

And the Quran is the easiest of knowledge to remember, so what of the other sciences.

## 3. Asking the people of knowledge

**This is engaging with the scholar**

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] was asked how he attained knowledge, and said:
> بلسانٍ سؤول وقلبٍ عقول
> 
> “By a tongue that asks constantly and a heart that comprehends.”

Another example is the [[Hadith of Jibril]] in Shahih Muslim, where [[Jibril]] taught us through asking questions and receiving answers.

### Manners of Asking Questions

**Avoid**:
- asking awkward questions
- rude behaviour in asking
- continuously asking even after the answer has been given
- hypothetical questions
- questions intended to test the shaykh

### Keep a list of questions

Usdath advises us to **maintain a list of questions to ask people of knowledge,** So that when you meet them, you have questions to ask.

# The Fourteenth Principle: Honouring and Respecting the People of Knowledge 

## The scholar is a father of the soul

**The evidence for this is:**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Ahzab]] ([[33:6]]) 
> 
> ٱلنَّبِىُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَأَزْوَٰجُهُۥٓ أُمَّهَـٰتُهُمْ ۗ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍۢ فِى كِتَـٰبِ ٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَٱلْمُهَـٰجِرِينَ إِلَّآ أَن تَفْعَلُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰٓ أَوْلِيَآئِكُم مَّعْرُوفًۭا ۚ كَانَ ذَٰلِكَ فِى ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ مَسْطُورًۭا ٦
> 
> The Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves, and his wives are [in the position of] their mothers. And those of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the decree of Allāh than the [other] believers and the emigrants, except that you may do to your close associates a kindness [through bequest]. That was in the Book inscribed.

> [!Quran] From the recitation of [[Ubayy ibn Ka'b]] of this ayah ([33:6]):
> 
> ٱلنَّبِىُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ ==وهو أبٌ لهم==
> 
> “The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, ==and he is a father to them==.”

> [!Quote] The shaykh says
> The fatherhood mentioned in this āyah is **not the fatherhood of lineage**, by consensus. **Rather, it is the fatherhood of the religion and soul**. 
> 
> Therefore, recognising the right of the teachers is a clear obligation. 

## The student is like a slave to the scholar

> [!Quote] [[Shu'bah ibn al-Hajjaj]] said:
> 
> كل من سمعتُ منه حديثًا فأنا له عبد
> 
> “I am like a servant to everyone from whom I learned a ḥadīth.”

(This does not mean slavery of ownership, but humility and gratitude.)

**The evidence for this is**: 

> [!Quran] [[Al-Kahf]] ([[18:60]])
> وَإِذْ قَالَ مُوسَىٰ ==لِفَتَىٰهُ== لَآ أَبْرَحُ حَتَّىٰٓ أَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ ٱلْبَحْرَيْنِ أَوْ أَمْضِىَ حُقُبًۭا ٦٠
> 
> And [mention] when Moses **said to his boy [i.e., servant]**, "I will not cease [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period."

> [!Quote] The shaykh explains
> This ayah refers to [[Yusha' ibn Noon]], and he was not really a slave that [[Musa]] possessed; rather he was taking knowledge from him, and following him, so due to that, Allāh made him his 'boy'."

## We must honour the people of knowledge:

**The evidence for this is**

> [!Hadith] Narrated Ubādah ibn aṣ- Ṣāmit:
> لَيْسَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي مَنْ لَمْ يُجِلَّ كَبِيرَنَا، وَيَرْحَمْ صَغِيرَنَا، وَيَعْرِفْ لِعَالِمِنَا حَقَّهُ
> 
> the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:
> 
> "They are not from my nation, the one who does not; honour our elders, have mercy on our young, and give our scholars their right."
> 
> Musnad Ahmad 22755

> [!Quote] As [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] said to [[Zayd ibn Thaabit]]
> أَمْسَكَ ابْنُ عَبَّاسٍ بِرِكَابِ زَيْدِ بْنِ ثَابِتٍ، فَقَالَ: «أَتَمْسِكُ لِي وَأَنْتَ ابْنُ عَمِّ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ» ؟
> 
> قَالَ: «إِنَّا هَكَذَا نَصْنَعُ بِالْعُلَمَاءِ» 
> 
> One day, Ibn ‘Abbas took hold of the riding camel of Zayd ibn Thabit.
> 
> Zayd said: “Do you take hold of the reins for me, when you are the cousin of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?” 
> 
> Ibn ‘Abbas  replied: “This is how we behave towards the scholars.”

> [!Quote] The Shaykh mentions
> [[Ibn Hazm]] narrates **scholarly consensus** on the topic of having admiration for the scholars and honouring them

## From the manners towards the shaykh

- To be humble towards him
- To engage with him
- To not turn ones back to him
- To speak to him with reverence, without going to extremes
- To supplicate for him
- To not behave as though as though one is not in need of him 
- To not harm him in speech or action
- To be subtle in correcting him

### When the shaykh makes a mistake

1. **Confirm that the error was really made**
	- ie that he actually said what is claimed
	
2. **Confirm that it is really wrong**
	- by asking a person of knowledge, privately
	
3. **Do not follow him in that error**
	- It is not from honouring the shaykh to follow him in his error
	- Likewise it is not from honouring him to publicly rebuke him for the error
	
4. **Make an excuse for him & have husn al-dhann**
	- eg
		- Perhaps the Hadith did not reach him
		- Perhaps he did not recall the Hadith at that time
		- Perhaps the Shaykh had found a different wording for it
	- But this does not mean following him in the mistake
	
5. **Offer him advice in a gentle and private way**
	- And publicly rebuking is not called advice in the first place
	- You make as a condition of the advice that is should be accepted

> [!Quran] [[Taha]] ([[20:44]])
> فَقُولَا لَهُۥ قَوْلًۭا لَّيِّنًۭا لَّعَلَّهُۥ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَىٰ ٤٤
> 
> And [O Musa] speak to him [Fir'aun] with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear [Allāh]."
> 
>> And if this is for fir'aun, then what of your teacher?

6. **Preserve his status, so as to not belittle his honor in the hearts of the Muslims**
