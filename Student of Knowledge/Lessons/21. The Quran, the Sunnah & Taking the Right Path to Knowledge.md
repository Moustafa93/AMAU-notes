# The Fourth Principle: Focusing Your Attention on the Knowledge of the Qur’an and the Sunnah 

Evidence:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Zukhruf]] [(43:43)](https://quran.com/43/43) 
> فَٱسْتَمْسِكْ بِٱلَّذِىٓ أُوحِىَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَٰطٍۢ مُّسْتَقِيمٍۢ ٤٣
>
> So adhere to that which is revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a straight path.

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]] said
> مَنْ أَرَادَ الْعِلْمَ فَلْيُثَوِّرِ الْقُرْآنَ، فَإِنَّ فِيهِ عِلْمَ الْأَوَّلِينَ وَالْآخِرِينَ
> 
> Whoever wants knowledge, let him examine the Qur'an, for it contains the knowledge of the early and latter people.

> [!Quote] [[Masruq ibn al-Ajda']] said
> “We did not ask the companions of Muhammad ﷺ about anything except that its knowledge was found in the Qur’an, but our understanding of it fell short.”

> [!Bio] [[Masruq ibn al-Ajda']]
> Nobel Tabi'i from the scholars of kufa
> d. 62 AH

 
> [!Poem] From the poetry of [[Qadhi Iyaad]] (d. 554 AH)
> الْعِلْمُ فِي أَصْلَيْنِ لَا يَعْدُوهُمَا ... إِلَّا الْمُضِلُّ عَنِ الطَّرِيقِ اللَّاحِبِ
>
> عِلْمُ الْكِتَابِ وَعِلْمُ الْآثَارِ الَّتِي ... قَدْ أُسْنِدَتْ عَنْ تَابِعٍ عَنْ صَاحِبِ
> 
> “Knowledge is found in two sources - none transgresses them
>  ... except one misguided from the clear path:
>
> Knowledge of the Book, and knowledge of the narrations
> ... transmitted from a Tābi‘ī from a Companion.”

This was the knowledge of the early generations. With time, knowledge decreased and speech increased.

# The Fifth Principle: Taking the Proper Path Which Will Lead To It 

> [!Quote]
> Knowledge has a path; whoever takes the wrong one will be misguided and will not achieve his target, and perhaps will get very little benefit for a great amount of effort.

> [!Quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said
> الْجَهْلُ بِالطَّرِيقِ وَآفَاتِهَا وَالْمَقْصُودِ يُوجِبُ التَّعَب الْكَثِير مَعَ الْفَائِدَةِ الْقَلِيلَةِ
> 
> Ignorance of the path, its hardships, and the objective necessitates much effort with little benefit.

Note [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] mentioned three things here:
1. Not knowing the path
2. Not being prepared for hardship
3. Loosing sight of the objective

And these are the three ways in which people can go wrong.

Usdadh recommends a book on the topic: by [[Obstacles In the Path of Seeking knowledge]] Shaykh [[Abd al-Salam Ibn Burjiz]]


> [!Poem] [[Muhammad Murtada al-Zabidi]] (d. 1205 AH) described this method comprehensively:
> فَمَا حَاوَلَ الْغَايَاتِ فِي أَلْفِ سَنَةٍ ... شَخْصٌ فَخُذْ مِنْ كُلِّ فَنٍّ أَحْسَنَهُ
> 
> بِحِفْظِ مَتْنٍ جَامِعٍ لِلرَّاجِحِ ... تَأْخُذُهُ عَنْ مُفِيدٍ نَاصِحِ
> 
> “You will not attain the end of knowledge in a thousand years—
> ... So take from every science its best.
> By memorizing a comprehensive, reliable text,
> ...Taken from one who benefits and sincerely advises.”

These lines in a very summarised yet comprehensive way, summarise the correct path to seeking knowledge.

- Take from every science, not just one
- Choose the best book, not just anything
- Memorise a text
	- That is comprehensive
	- And reliable / widely accepted / correct
- Take it from someone
	- Mufīd - Who benefits / is qualified
	- Nāṣiḥ - Who nurtures you, is sincere and practices what he teaches

The proof of taking knowledge from the teacher:

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]]
> تَسْمَعُونَ وَيُسْمَعُ مِنْكُمْ وَيُسْمَعُ مِمَّنْ سَمِعَ مِنْكُمْ
> 
> The Prophet (ﷺ) said: You hear (from me), and others will hear from you; and people will hear from them who heard from you.

He ﷺ is describing chain of narration.

> [!Question] How is methodology of seeking knowledge of relevance to the topic of the etiquette of seeking knowledge?
> If you are sincere and revere knowledge, you will only seek it in the way that it deserves to be sought
