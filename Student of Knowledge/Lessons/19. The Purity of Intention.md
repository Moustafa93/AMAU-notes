# The second principle - purity of intention

Ikhlas revolves around two things:
- cleansing the heart (previous lesson)
- connecting the heart to Allah


> [!Quote] As the poet said
> إِخْلَاصُنَا لِلَّهِ صَفْوُ الْقَلْبِ مِنْ ... إِرَادَةٍ سِوَاهُ فَاحْذَرْ يَا فَطِنُ
> 
> Our sincerity to Allah is cleansing the heart from desiring anything besides Him, so beware, O intelligent one.

The foundation of every action is sincerity.

Evidence for sincerity:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Bayyinah]]  [98:5](https://quran.com/98:5) 
>  وَمَآ أُمِرُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ حُنَفَآءَ وَيُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ ٱلْقَيِّمَةِ ٥
 >
 >And they were not commanded except to worship Allāh, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakāh. And that is the correct religion.


> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Omar ibn al-Khattab]]:
>  أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ "‏ الأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّةِ، وَلِكُلِّ امْرِئٍ مَا نَوَى، فَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ، فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ هِجْرَتُهُ لِدُنْيَا يُصِيبُهَا، أَوِ امْرَأَةٍ يَتَزَوَّجُهَا، فَهِجْرَتُهُ إِلَى مَا هَاجَرَ إِلَيْهِ ‏"
>  
>  Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The reward of deeds depends upon the intention and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his emigration was for Allah and His Apostle. And whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."
>
>{ [Bukhari 54](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:54) }

Fundamental principle in Islam:
- Actions are judged in according to your intention.
- You are rewarded for your intention.

Side benefit: This Hadith has an Ahad chain of narration. Yet many scholars begin their books with it. 

> [!Quote] [[Imam Al-Shafi'i]] said regarding this hadith:
> إِنَّهُ يَدْخُلُ فِي سَبْعِينَ بَابًا مِنَ الْعِلْمِ
> 
> Indeed, it enters into seventy chapters of knowledge.


Niyyah carries two meanings:
1. **qaṣd al-ʿibādah** - the intention that distinguishes 'ibadah from custom, and one ibadah from another
2. **qaṣd al-maʿbūd** -  who is the act done for

Ikhlas refers to the second type, qaṣd al-maʿbūd.

> [!Quote] Abū Bakr al-Marwazī narrated regarding [[Imam Ahmad]]:
> سَمِعْتُ رَجُلًا يَقُولُ لِأَبِي عَبْدِ اللَّهِ، وَذَكَرَ لَهُ الصِّدْقَ وَالْإِخْلَاصَ
> فَقَالَ أَبُو عَبْدِ اللَّهِ: بِهَذَا ارْتَفَعَ الْقَوْمُ
> 
> I heard a man say to Abū ʿAbdillāh ([[Imam Ahmad]]) mentioning truthfulness and sincerity, so Abū ʿAbdillāh said: By these, the people were raised.

Ikhlas vs Sidq

Explained in a few ways
- Some say: Sidq (truthfulness/being genuine) is the beginning, and ikhlas develops from it.
- Others said sidq refers to intention before beginning the action, while ikhlas refers to maintaining the sincerity after beginning


> [!Quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] explained it as follows:
> فَالْمُخْلِصُ لَا رِيَاءَ لَهُ، وَالصَّادِقُ لَا إِعْجَابَ لَهُ
> وَلَا يَتِمُّ الْإِخْلَاصُ إِلَّا بِالصِّدْقِ، وَلَا الصِّدْقُ إِلَّا بِالْإِخْلَاصِ، وَلَا يَتِمَّانِ إِلَّا بِالصَّبْرِ
> 
> The sincere person does not show off, and the truthful person is not amazed by himself. Sincerity cannot be complete without truthfulness, nor truthfulness without sincerity, and neither is complete except with patience.

Another way to look at it: Ikhlas is that your intention is for Allah alone, and that Sidq is that your internal self matches your external self.


The Shaykh mentions that sincerity in knowledge is built upon four principles.
1. Rafʿu al-jahl ʿan nafsih
	Removing ignorance from oneself.
	- Ignorance in belief
	- Ignorance in acts of worship
	- Ignorance in commands and prohibitions
2. Rafʿu al-jahl ʿan al-khalq
	 Removing ignorance from the creation.
3. Iḥyāʾ al-ʿilm
	 Reviving knowledge (& protecting it from being lost.)
4. Al-ʿamal bil-ʿilm
	 Acting upon the knowledge.

Principle 1 and 4 are individual obligations.
Principle 2 is a collective obligation.
Principle 3 is a recommended sunnah


> [!poem] A poet summarised these intentions:
> أَطْلُبُ الْعِلْمَ لِوَجْهِ اللَّهِ ... مِنْ غَيْرِ مَرَاءَةٍ وَلَا تُبَاهِي
>  لِتَقْصِدَ أَرْبَعَةً قَبْلَ ابْتِدَاءِ ...  تَعَّلُمٍ لِكَيْ تَفُوزَ بِالْهُدَى
>  أَوَّلُهَا الْخُرُوجُ عَنْ ضَلَال ... وَالثَّانِي نَفْعُ خَلْقِ ذِيالْجَلَالِ
>  وَالثَّالِثُ الْإِحْيَاءُ لِلْعُلُومِ ... وَالرَّابِعُ الْعَمَلُ بِالْمَعْلُومِ
>  
> Seek knowledge for the face of Allah
> ... without showing off or competing
> Intend four things before beginning
> ... to learn, in order to get the prize of guidance:
> The first - to come out of ignorance,
> ... the second - benefiting the creation of the owner of majesty
> The third - reviving knowledge, 
> ... and the fourth - acting upon what you know.

>[!poem] Shaykh [[Salih al 'Usaymi]] also summarised the intentions in his own poetry:
> وَنِيَّةٌ لِلْعِلْمِ رَفَعُ الجَهْلِ عَمْ ... عَنْ نَفْسِهِ فَغَيْرِهِ مِنَ النَّسَمُ
> وَالثَّالِثُ التَّحْصِينُ لِلعُلُومِ مِنْ ... ضَيَاعِهَا وَعَمَلٌ بِهِ زُكِنْ
> 
> The intention for knowledge is to remove ignorance
> ... from oneself and others from the creation
> The third is to protect knowledge from
> ... being lost, and to act upon it firmly
> 
> 

## Knowledge and action
 
> [!Quote]
> Knowledge is a tree, and action is its fruit. **Knowledge is only sought in order to act upon it.**

## Fear of losing scincerity

The early generations feared losing sincerity in seeking knowledge.

 > [!quote] [[Hishaam al-Dastawaa'i]] (d. 154 AH) said
 > By Allah, I cannot say that I went of a single day to seek hadith intending the face of Allah.
 
> [!Quote] [[Imam Ahmad]] was asked "did you seek knowledge for Allah?". He replied:
> لِلَّهِ؟ عَزِيزٌ! وَلَكِنَّهُ شَيْءٌ حُبِّبَ إِلَيَّ فَطَلَبْتُهُ
> 
> For Allah? That is something hard. But it was something beloved to me, so I sought it.


> [!Quote] [[Sufyan al-Thawri]] (d. 161) said
> مَا عَالَجْتُ شَيْئًا أَشَدَّ عَلَيَّ مِنْ نِيَّتِي لِأَنَّهَا تَتَقَلَّبُ عَلَيَّ
> 
> I never struggled with anything harder than my intention, because it turns on me.

> [!quote] [[Sulaimaan al-Haashimi]] (d. 219 AH) said
> Perhaps I would narrate a single Hadith with a certain intention, then when I would come to a certain part of it my intention would change. So a single ḥadīth requires multiple intentions.

This shows us that sincerity is not just at the beginning of the action, but may need to perfect your intention multiple times throughout the action, to prevent it becoming corrupted.

How can intentions corrupt?
1. A regular 'ibadah may turn into a mindless custom/habit
2. An 'ibadah may turn into showing off or doing the action for other than Allah
