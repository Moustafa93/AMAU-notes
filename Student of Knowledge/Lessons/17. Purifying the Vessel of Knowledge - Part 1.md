# The First Principle: Purifying the Vessel of Knowledge

The vessel of knowledge is the heart.


> [!quote] 
> Knowledge will enter the heart according to its purity. If its purity increases, its readiness for knowledge increases

Evidence that the knowledge is inside the heart:

> [!Quran] [ Al Ankabut (29:49)](https://quran.com/29/49)  
> بَلْ هُوَ ءَايَـٰتٌۢ بَيِّنَـٰتٌۭ فِى صُدُورِ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمَ ۚ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَٔايَـٰتِنَآ إِلَّا ٱلظَّـٰلِمُونَ ٤٩
> 
> Rather, it [i.e., the Qur’ān] is distinct verses [preserved] within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers.

The word the shaykh uses is وِعاء - this generally refers to a vessel that is see through. So likewise, if the vessel is dirty, then the water will not be pure.

How to purify the heart? Two principles
1. Purifying from shubuhaat
2. Purifying from shahawaat.

**Shubha**: From arabic word meaning resemblance.

"False notion/misguided idea/misconception that has a certain resemblance to the truth"

**Shahawaat**: desires

Shubuhaat are typically worse and more harmful than shahawaat.

Bid'iyaat and shirkiyaat typically come from shubuhaat, while major and minor sins typically come from shahawaat.

Shubuhaat can lead to very very dangerous things. Eg the person who killed Ali did so because of shubuhaat.

And the answer to shubuhaat is knowledge.

As for the shahawaat, the cure is tazkiyah al-nafs.

Evidence for purifying the heart:

> [!Quran] [Al-Muddaththir 74:4](https://www.quran.com/74:4)
> وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ ٤
> 
> And your clothing purify.

> [!Quote]
> This is based on the interpretation of those who say that the meaning of garments is the inner-self; and it is a good opinion, which has been derived in a sound way.

3 views about the clothing
1. referring to clothing
2. referring to actions (view of [[Ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], and majority view of the early generations)
3. referring to the heart

There are 2 examples of pre-Islamic poetry to support the position that the shaykh brings:

> [!Quote] Poetry of [[Imru' al-Qais]] (Considered to be the greatest of poets from the pre-Islamic times d. approx 540 CE)
> وإن تك قد ساءتك مني خليقةٌ ... فسلي ثيابي من ثيابك تنسل
> 
> If a mannerism of mine has displeased you
> ... Then strip by "thiyaab" from "thiyaab" (meaning heart) and I will depart from you
 
(common theme of pre-Islamic poetry was poetry written for a woman etc)
 
> [!Quote] From the poetry of [[Antarah ibn Shaddaad]] (famous for his poetry about war/valour/bravery, d. approx 608 CE)
>  فَشَكَكتُ بِالرُمحِ الأَصَمِّ ثِيابَهُ ... لَيسَ الكَريمُ عَلى القَنا بِمُحَرَّمِ
>  
>  I stabbed with a firm spear his thiyab (heart)
>  ... for the noble one is not forbidden to the spear

The shaykh then goes on to mention a logical evidence

> [!Quote] 
> If you are shy that a created being like you should see your dirty clothes, then be shy of Allāh looking at your heart while there is rancour, afflictions, sins and faults in it.

The shaykh gives further proof for purifying the heart:

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abu Hurayrah]]
> إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى صُوَرِكُمْ وَأَمْوَالِكُمْ وَلَكِنْ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَأَعْمَالِكُمْ
> 
> Verily Allah does not look to your faces and your wealth but He looks to your heart and to your deeds.
> 
> [Muslim 2564c](https://sunnah.com/muslim:2564c)

Can add to that by way of explanation the statement [[Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah]] (d. 80 AH, Sahabi, one of the 10 who were promised paradise)
 
> [!Quote] [[Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah]] said
> ألا رُبَ مُبَيِضٍ لِثِيَابِهِ مُدَنَّسٍ لِدِينِه
> 
> Perhaps he who whitens his clothes taints his religion

[[Ibn Al-Jawzi]] mentioned the people without knowledge suffer this the most, and one of the ways that you can see people suffering this is a lack of "thabaat"/firmness. 

> [!Quote] [[Sahl ibn Abdillah]] (d 283 AH) said
> حرام على قلب أن يدخله النور وفيه شيء مما يكره الله عز وجل
> 
> It is forbidden for light to enter a
heart when it has within it something which
Allāh, Mighty and Majestic, hates.
 
Note/side benefit: Haram can be used in two ways:
1. Haram by Qadr
2. Haram by legislation

Further evidence:
 
> [!Quran] [Al-A'raf (7:146)](https://quran.com/7/146)
> سَأَصْرِفُ عَنْ ءَايَـٰتِىَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَتَكَبَّرُونَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ ٱلْحَقِّ وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كُلَّ ءَايَةٍۢ لَّا يُؤْمِنُوا۟ بِهَا وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ سَبِيلَ ٱلرُّشْدِ لَا يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًۭا وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ سَبِيلَ ٱلْغَىِّ يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلًۭا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُوا۟ بِـَٔايَـٰتِنَا وَكَانُوا۟ عَنْهَا غَـٰفِلِينَ ١٤٦
> 
> I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right; and if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. And if they see the way of consciousness, they will not adopt it as a way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as a way. That is because they have denied Our signs and they were heedless of them.

And arrogance is an action of the heart. And Allah here says he will turn away from His signs, ie turn away from knowledge, those people with this action of the heart.

This is a example of mentioning one thing and intending all - all of the sicknesses of the heart full under this. Arrogance is given here by way of example.

> [!quote] [[Sufyan ibn 'Uyayna]]  (d 198 AH) said about this
> It means "I prevent them from understanding the Quran"

> [!quote] [[Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Firiyabi]] (d 212 AH) said
> It means "I prevent their hearts from reflecting over this religion"

But what about people who are arrogant and still memorise?

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Haaj al-Maaliki]] said
> It is known for sure that some arrogant people memorise the Quran and other forms of knowledge, **however they are prohibitted from the benefit of it, which is to understand and act upon it**, that is what was being really sought. So the common-folk are in a better situation than them in this, and Allah is the one in Whose help is sought.

Side note: Someone may say, how can you quote from [[Sahl ibn Abdillah]] et al, when they are known as being from the suffiyyah?

Shaykh ul-Islam [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] mentioned regarding them that they were from the early suffiyyah who had an exaggeration in zuhd (ie they had poor clothing and kept away from the dunya) but they did not have the Aqeedah issues that the later Sufis had.

Also not everyone who in their biography is mentioned that they were a Sufi, is actually a sufi. Many times the Sufis will just put this in their biographies to attribute them to themselves.
