# The virtue of writing - فَضْلُ الكِتَابَة
## The Virtue According to the Quran

**We have the evidence:**

> [!quran] [[Al-Rahman]] (55:1-4)
> 
> ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنُ ١
> The Most Merciful
> عَلَّمَ ٱلْقُرْءَانَ ٢
> Taught the Qur’ān,
> خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ ٣
> Created man,
> عَلَّمَهُ ==ٱلْبَيَانَ== ٤
> [And] taught him "Al-Batayan".

**And we have the way in which this is an evidence** (Wajh al-Dalalah)

> [!quote] [[Ibn al-Qayyim]] said:
> Al-Bayyaan (Clarification) is of 2 types:
> 1. al-Bayyaan al-Nutqiy: Oral clarification
> 2. al-Bayyan al-khatiy: Written clarification

> [!NOTE] Ustadhs note-taking 
> Ustadh will not write this out in full. He uses diagrams.
>

**A second evidence:**

> [!Quran] [[Al-'Alaq]] (96:1-5)
> ٱقْرَأْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ١
> Recite in the name of your Lord who created
> خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ ٢
> Created man from a clinging substance.
> ٱقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْأَكْرَمُ ٣
> Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous -
> ==ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ== ٤
> Who taught by the pen
> عَلَّمَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ ٥
> Taught man that which he knew not.

## The Virtue According to the Sunnah

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abu Hurayrah]]
> The Prophet ﷺ said:
> "اكْتُبُوا لأَبِي شَاهٍ"
> 
> "Write it for Abu Shah"
> 
> { Bukhari and Muslim }

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abu Hurayrah]]
> The Prophet ﷺ said:
> 
> إِذَا مَاتَ الإِنْسَانُ انْقَطَعَ عَنْهُ عَمَلُهُ إِلاَّ مِنْ ثَلاَثَةٍ إِلاَّ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ ==أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ== أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ
> 
> When a man dies, his acts come to an end, but three, recurring charity, **or knowledge (by which people) benefit**, or a pious son, who prays for him (for the deceased).
> 
> { Muslim 1631 }

> [!NOTE] You should write ﷺ in full

## The Virtue According to the Salaf

> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn Mubarak]] said about writing
> لَوْلاَ الكِتَابُ مَا حَفِظْنَا
> 
> Were it not for writing it down (or the book), we would not have memorized it.

> [!quote]  [[Imam Al-Shafi'i]] said
> اعْلَمُوا رَحِمَكُمُ اللَّهُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْعِلْمَ يَنِدُّ كَمَا تَنِدُّ الْإِبِلُ فَاجْعَلُوا الْكُتُبَ لَهُ حُمَاةً وَالْأَقْلَامَ عَلَيْهِ رُعَاةً
> 
> Know, may Allah have mercy on you, that this knowledge leaves, like the camels lose their humps. So, make books as its fortification, and pens as its guardians

> [!NOTE] Ustadhs note-taking
> Ustadh will alternate colours for different speakers in a quote.

> Ustadh likes to include poetry to memorise

# The permissibility of writing
## The first view: it is impermissible to write anything except the Quran

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Sa'eed al Khudri]] narrated
> عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ﷺ قَالَ ‏ "‏ لاَ تَكْتُبُوا عَنِّي وَمَنْ كَتَبَ عَنِّي غَيْرَ الْقُرْآنِ فَلْيَمْحُهُ وَحَدِّثُوا عَنِّي وَلاَ حَرَجَ وَمَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَىَّ - قَالَ هَمَّامٌ أَحْسِبُهُ قَالَ - مُتَعَمِّدًا فَلْيَتَبَوَّأْ مَقْعَدَهُ مِنَ النَّارِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏
> 
> Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Do not take down anything from me, and he who took down anything from me except the Qur'an, he should efface that and narrate from me, for there is no harm in it and he who attributed any falsehood to me -(and Hammam said: I think he also said: " deliberately")- he should in fact find his abode in the Hell-Fire.
> 
> { Muslim 3004 }

**From those who held this opinion are:** 

From the Sahaba:
- [[Omar ibn al-Khattab]] (later changed his view)
- [[Abu Sa'eed al Khudri]]
- [[Abdullah ibn Mas'uud]]
- [[Abu Musa al-Ash'ari]]
- [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]]
- [[Ibn 'Umar]]
- [[al-Mughirah]]

From the Tabi’in:
- [['Ubaydullah ibn Mas'ud]]
- [['Abeedatah al-Salamaani]]
- [[Ad-dahaak ibn Muzaahim al-Hilaali]]
- [[al-A'amash]]

> [!NOTE] Ustadhs note-taking
> ![[Pasted image 20251226161922.png]]

## The second view: it is permissible to write other than the Quran

**From the Sahahabah who held this opinion are:** 
- [[Abu Bakr]]
- [[Omar ibn al-Khattab]]
- [['Uthman]]
- [['Ali]]
- [[Abu Sa'eed al Khudri]]
- [[Anas ibn Maalik]]

**The evidence includes:**

> [!Quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] ([[2:282]] - ayat al-dayn, longest ayah in the Quran)
> يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا تَدَايَنتُم بِدَيْنٍ إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍۢ مُّسَمًّۭى ==فَٱكْتُبُوهُ ۚ== وَلْيَكْتُب بَّيْنَكُمْ كَاتِبٌۢ بِٱلْعَدْلِ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ كَاتِبٌ أَن يَكْتُبَ كَمَا عَلَّمَهُ ٱللَّهُ ۚ فَلْيَكْتُبْ وَلْيُمْلِلِ ٱلَّذِى عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ وَلْيَتَّقِ ٱللَّهَ رَبَّهُۥ وَلَا يَبْخَسْ مِنْهُ شَيْـًۭٔا ۚ فَإِن كَانَ ٱلَّذِى عَلَيْهِ ٱلْحَقُّ سَفِيهًا أَوْ ضَعِيفًا أَوْ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَن يُمِلَّ هُوَ فَلْيُمْلِلْ وَلِيُّهُۥ بِٱلْعَدْلِ ۚ وَٱسْتَشْهِدُوا۟ شَهِيدَيْنِ مِن رِّجَالِكُمْ ۖ فَإِن لَّمْ يَكُونَا رَجُلَيْنِ فَرَجُلٌۭ وَٱمْرَأَتَانِ مِمَّن تَرْضَوْنَ مِنَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءِ أَن تَضِلَّ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَىٰهُمَا ٱلْأُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَلَا يَأْبَ ٱلشُّهَدَآءُ إِذَا مَا دُعُوا۟ ۚ وَلَا تَسْـَٔمُوٓا۟ أَن تَكْتُبُوهُ صَغِيرًا أَوْ كَبِيرًا إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلِهِۦ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَقْسَطُ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ وَأَقْوَمُ لِلشَّهَـٰدَةِ وَأَدْنَىٰٓ أَلَّا تَرْتَابُوٓا۟ ۖ إِلَّآ أَن تَكُونَ تِجَـٰرَةً حَاضِرَةًۭ تُدِيرُونَهَا بَيْنَكُمْ فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْكُمْ جُنَاحٌ أَلَّا تَكْتُبُوهَا ۗ وَأَشْهِدُوٓا۟ إِذَا تَبَايَعْتُمْ ۚ وَلَا يُضَآرَّ كَاتِبٌۭ وَلَا شَهِيدٌۭ ۚ وَإِن تَفْعَلُوا۟ فَإِنَّهُۥ فُسُوقٌۢ بِكُمْ ۗ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ ۖ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌۭ ٢٨٢
> 
> O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, **write it down**. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allāh has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation [i.e., the debtor] dictate. And let him fear Allāh, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of them [i.e., the women] errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allāh and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And fear Allāh. And Allāh teaches you. And Allāh is Knowing of all things.

Additional evidence includes the aforementioned Hadith of Abi Shaah.

[[Imam al-Nawawi]] & [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] transmitted ijma'ah on the permissibility.

## Reconciling between the two opinions:

It was prohibited during revelation out of fear of the Qur'an and Hadith being put together

# Writing benefits from books

**The benefits are of two types:**

1. Vital benefits that must be kept
	(Marbit al-Faras - The objective of the speech)

2. Benefits of lesser priority

## The method of documenting benefits

**Writing in the book**

This has 2 types:
1. On the cover (or blank pages) of the book
2. Inside the book (in the margins)

**Writing n a card / piece of paper / sticky note**

**Writing in a notebook**

ie a notebook that is specific to the benefits from one book

**Writing it on paper and sticking it on the wall**

This can be done for memorisation. Can keep the benefit on the wall until it has been memorised, and replace with something else.

 **Recording in audio form, rather than writing**

For example, recording the benefits on their phone, saving each benefit as "benefit 1", "benefit 2" and so on. They can then listen to these benefits when they are driving.

## The process of writing in books

Ustadh gives an example as to his methodology of writing in books, using a book from his librabry.

### Front of the book

**Summarise the objectives of the book**:

![[snapshot 6.jpg]]

**Summarise the Muhaqqiqs introduction** (eg biography of the author). 

Ustadh did so on a card:

![[snapshot 7.jpg]]

**Write the personal contents page**

Ustadh did so on the blank pages after the muhaqqiqs introduction.

(if he runs out of space, he will continue on an A4 paper, that can be stored in the book)

![[snapshot 8.jpg]]

### Inside the book

**Write benefits in the margins**

These can include:
- Explanation of a statement
- Benefits from other books
- An answer to a question you had, or something you did not understand but found the answer to
- Poetry that helps to remember a point

![[snapshot 9.jpg]]

![[snapshot 10.jpg]]

### Collect all of the benefits

**List all the benefits from the book.**

Can do so in the **back of the book** as in the example, or in a **separate notebook**.
