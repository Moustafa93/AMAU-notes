# Synonymous definitions can have subtleties

There are a number of words that are used for 'Aqeedah.

They can be used anonymously, but there can be subtle differences.

For example:
- Tawheed could be used as a complete synonym for Aqeedah
- Or Tawheed could refer specifically the subject matter regarding worshipping Allah alone, while the rest of subject matter is called using Aqeedah.

# Definition of Tawheed

## Linguistic meaning | التعريف اللغوي

Verbal noun | مصدر
From:  وَحَّدَة يُوَحِّدُ

"**To make something one/to declare something one**"

Examples:
- Being united on a word : توحيد الكلمات
- The year the country became one : عام توحيد البلد

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Jaabir ibn Abdullah]]
> فَأَهَلَّ ==بِالتَّوْحِيدِ== ‏"‏ لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ لَبَّيْكَ..."
> 
> He (the Messenger ﷺ) pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying):" Labbaik,0 Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik.
> 
> {{  Sahih Muslim 1218a }}

**Benefit**: This word was known to the Sahaaba.

## Technical definition | التعريف الاصطلاحي

"**To testify that nobody deserves to be worshipped except Allah**"

**Usage in the Sunnah**:

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]]
> لَمَّا بَعَثَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم مُعَاذًا نَحْوَ الْيَمَنِ قَالَ لَهُ ‏ "‏ إِنَّكَ تَقْدَمُ عَلَى قَوْمٍ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ فَلْيَكُنْ أَوَّلَ مَا تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَى أَنْ يُوَحِّدُوا اللَّهَ تَعَالَى ..."
> 
> When the Prophet (ﷺ) sent Mu'adh ([[Mu'adh ibn Jabal]]) to Yemen, he said to him, "You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Allah.
> 
> {{ Sahih al-Bukhari 7372 }}

This Hadith came in multiple wordings:

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]]
> فَلْيَكُنْ أَوَّلَ مَا تَدْعُوهُمْ إِلَيْهِ عِبَادَةُ اللَّهِ
> 
> First of all invite them to worship Allah
> 
> {{ Sahih al-Bukhari 1458 }}
> 

> [!Hadith] Narrated [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] from [[Mu'adh ibn Jabal]] 
> فَادْعُهُمْ إِلَى شَهَادَةِ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ
> 
> so first call them to testify that there is no god but Allah and that I (Muhammad) am the messenger of Allah
> 
> {{ Sahih Muslim 19a }}

**Benefit**: From the benefits of having one Hadith with varying wordings is that each explains the other

So, in the view of the early generations, the following three terms mean the same thing:
- Tawheed
- Ibadah
- La illaha illa Allah

# The Pillars of Tawheed are Two

> لا إله
1. **Negation** | النفي
   
Negating that anything else deserves to be worshipped.

> إلّا الله
2. **Affirmation** | الإثبات

Affirming that only Allah deserves to be worshipped

**If either of the pillars are absent**:

- Negation without affirmation = **atheism**
- Affirmation with negation = **polytheism** / shirk

ie **Negation + affirmation = tawheed**.

## The tahleel

The tahleel is understood as:

> لَا إِلَهَ ==بِحَقٍّ== إِلَّا اللهُ

There is none that ==deserves== to be worshipped except for Allah 

We are not negating that there are people who worship besides Allah. We are negating that those are deserving of worship.

## Negation and affirmation in the Quran

> [!quran] [[Al-Baqarah]] ([[2:256]]) 
> 
> لَآ إِكْرَاهَ فِى ٱلدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ ٱلرُّشْدُ مِنَ ٱلْغَىِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِٱلطَّـٰغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِنۢ بِٱللَّهِ فَقَدِ ٱسْتَمْسَكَ بِٱلْعُرْوَةِ ٱلْوُثْقَىٰ لَا ٱنفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَٱللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ ٢٥٦
> 
> There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become distinct from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in ṭāghūt and believes in Allāh has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allāh is Hearing and Knowing.

We are told to:
- Disbelieve in everything worshipped besides Allah (negation)
- Worship Allah alone (afirmation)
This is  لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ

> [!homework] Research other ayaat that explain لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ
> Will be answered in subsequent lesson

## The word إِلَه means مَعبود

The word إِلَه is central to لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ. Changing it's meaning will change the meaning of the tahleel and of tawheed.

**Evidence*:

> [!Quran] [[Al-Zukhruf]] ([[43:45]]) 
> 
> وَسْـَٔلْ مَنْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رُّسُلِنَآ أَجَعَلْنَا مِن دُونِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ءَالِهَةًۭ يُعْبَدُونَ ٤٥
> 
> And ask those We sent before you of Our messengers; have We made besides the Most Merciful deities to be worshipped?

Also, the hadith of [[Mu'adh ibn Jabal]] above

## War Against 'Ibadah

There is a war against ahl al-Sunnah

One of the key objects is to remove the concept of worship, that is to open up لا إله إلّا الله to everyone.

In doing so, it allows the leaders of misguidance to claim to be following the Quran and the Sunnah, integrate with the Muslims, and to have many followers.

### Method 1: redefine إِلَه

The first method is to redefine إِلَه to mean الخالق (The creator) or المدبّر (The controller).

This is dangerous. It would mean that most people in the world & most religions follow لا إله إلّا الله 

The response is simple::

> [!Quran] [[Al-Kafirun]] ([[109:1]])
> قُلْ يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْكَـٰفِرُونَ
> 
> Say, "O disbelievers,
> لَآ أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ
> 
> I do not worship what you worship.

He did not say to Quraysh "I do not believe that there is a creator besides Allah, and you believe there is a creator besides Allah."

**Quraysh believed in Allah as the Creator:**

> [!Quran] [[Luqman]] ([[31:25]]) 
> 
> وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ ٱللَّهُ ۚ قُلِ ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ٢٥
> 
> And if you asked them, "Who created the heavens and earth?" they would surely say, "Allāh." Say, "[All] praise is [due] to Allāh"; but most of them do not know.

> [!Quran] [[Al-Zumar]] ([[39:3]]) 
> 
> أَلَا لِلَّهِ ٱلدِّينُ ٱلْخَالِصُ ۚ وَٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّخَذُوا۟ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوْلِيَآءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَآ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰٓ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِى مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِى مَنْ هُوَ كَـٰذِبٌۭ كَفَّارٌۭ ٣
> 
> Unquestionably, for Allāh is the pure religion. And those who take protectors besides Him [say], "We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allāh in position." Indeed, Allāh will judge between them concerning that over which they differ. Indeed, Allāh does not guide he who is a liar and [confirmed] disbeliever.

> [!Quran] [[Yunus]] ([[10:18]]) 
> 
> وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ شُفَعَـٰٓؤُنَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ۚ قُلْ أَتُنَبِّـُٔونَ ٱللَّهَ بِمَا لَا يَعْلَمُ فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَلَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ۚ سُبْحَـٰنَهُۥ وَتَعَـٰلَىٰ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ ١٨
> 
> And they worship other than Allāh that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, "These are our intercessors with Allāh." Say, "Do you inform Allāh of something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?" Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.

> [!Quran] [[Luqman]] ([[31:32]]) 
> 
> وَإِذَا غَشِيَهُم مَّوْجٌۭ كَٱلظُّلَلِ دَعَوُا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّىٰهُمْ إِلَى ٱلْبَرِّ فَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌۭ ۚ وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَٔايَـٰتِنَآ إِلَّا كُلُّ خَتَّارٍۢ كَفُورٍۢ ٣٢
> 
> And when waves come over them like canopies, they supplicate Allāh, sincere to Him in religion [i.e., faith]. But when He delivers them to the land, there are [some] of them who are moderate [in faith]. And none rejects Our signs except everyone treacherous and ungrateful.

### Method 2: redefine 'Ibadah

There are those who will accept the above, and accept ahl al-Sunnahs definition of لا إله إلّا الله

But they will redefine 'Ibadah, in order to claim that their actions do not fall under it's defition.

For example, they will claim that there actions constitute Shafa’ah,Tabarruk, Tawassul etc

In reality, the meaning of 'Ibadah is known, and does not require a definition. When you see an act of worship, you know that that is an act of worship, regardless of what it is called.

Do not allow people to change the definition / present some technicality to take you away from this fitrah.

# Definition of Ibadah

There are a number of definitions suggested:

> [!Quote] The definition of [[Ibn Taymiyyah]]:
> 
> هِيَ اسْمٌ جَامِعٌ لِكُلِّ مَا يُحِبُّهُ اللهُ وَيَرْضَاهُ، مِنَ الْأَقْوَالِ وَالْأَعْمَالِ، الظَّاهِرَةِ وَالبَاطِنَةِ.
> 
> "It is a comprehensive term for everything that Allah love and is pleased with from statements and actions whether hidden or apparent.”

> [!Quote] The definition of [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mu'allimi]] (d 1386 AH)
> 
> > خُضوعٌ اختياريٌّ يُطْلَب به نفعٌ غيبيٌّ
> 
> "it is a voluntary act of submission through which an unseen benefit is sought.”

> [!Quote] It is defined in some books of fiqh as
> ما لا يُعقَل معناه
>
> It is what of which its meaning is not fully understood
> 
> >ie actions done out of obedience and submission to Allah, rather than logic
> >eg. if you break your wudhu by using the toilet, to perform wudhu you wash your face and arms etc, although these were not the areas that became physically dirty

**These meanings aren’t perfect, however it gives a general understanding.**

# Books of Tawheed

More modern curricula  will often split Tawheed and General Aqidah, while in the earlier times the two were synonymous.

**Books where Tawheed refers to general Aqeedah:**

- Kitab al-Tawhid by [[Ibn Khuzaymah]] (Muhammed Ibn Ishaq Ibn Khuzaymah Al- Shaafi’i al-Naysaburi, d. 311 AH)

- Kitab al-Tawhid by [[Ibn Mandah]] (Abu Abdillah Muhammed Ibn Ishaq Ibn Muhammed ibn Yahya ibn Mandah, d. 395H)


**Books where Tawheed refers to 'Ibadah specifically:**

- Kitab al-Tawhid by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] (d 1206 AH)
