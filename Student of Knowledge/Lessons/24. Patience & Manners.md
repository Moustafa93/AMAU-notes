# The Ninth Principle: Patience in Knowledge – Both in Attaining It and Passing It On


> [!Quote] [[Abdullah ibn 'Abbas]] said
> دَلَلْتُ طَالِبًا فَعَزَزْتُ مَطْلُوبًا
> 
> “I was humbled as a seeker, and I was honored when I became the one who was sought.”

**Patience is required in every stage of knowledge:**

- In taking it
- in gathering it
- in researching
- in spreading it
- in teaching it
- when challenges strike (known as المصابرة)

**The evidence for requiring  patience is**:

> [!Quran] [[Aal 'Imran]] ([[3:200]])
> يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱصْبِرُوا۟ وَصَابِرُوا۟ وَرَابِطُوا۟ وَٱتَّقُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ [٢٠٠](https://quran.com/3:200)
> 
> O you who have believed, persevere[1] and endure[2] and remain stationed[3] and fear Allāh that you may be successful.
> 

**Note on these similar words:**

- The term - ٱصْبِرُوا۟ :
	Being patient in terms of mindset 
		or 
	Being patient in yourself self

- The term وَصَابِرُوا۟ :
	Being patient when the challenge hits
		or
	Being patient with other people

> [!Quran] [[Al-Kahf]] ([[18:28]])
> وَٱصْبِرْ نَفْسَكَ مَعَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَدَوٰةِ وَٱلْعَشِىِّ يُرِيدُونَ وَجْهَهُۥ ۖ وَلَا تَعْدُ عَيْنَاكَ عَنْهُمْ تُرِيدُ زِينَةَ ٱلْحَيَوٰةِ ٱلدُّنْيَا ۖ وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُۥ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَٱتَّبَعَ هَوَىٰهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُۥ فُرُطًۭا [٢٨](https://quran.com/18:28)
> 
> And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His face [i.e., acceptance]. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.[1]
>> [[Yahya ibn abi Kathir]] said these are the gatherings of knowledge.

> [!Quote] Al-Asmaa'i said
> مَنْ لَمْ يَحْتَمِلْ ذَلَّ التَّعْلِيمِ سَاعَةً بَقِيَ فِي ذَلَّ الْجَهْلِ أَبَدًا
> 
> “Whoever cannot bear the lowliness of learning for a time (an hour), will have the lowliness of ignorance forever.”

> [!Text]
> Above and beyond these two types of patience is having patience with having patience with them, and remaining firm in having patience with them

*And this is what is meant by consistency - Sabr with Sabr*

# The Tenth Principle: Adhering to the Etiquette of Seeking Knowledge

**The evidence for this is:**

> [!Hadith] [[Abu Hurayrah]] narrated
> إِنَّمَا بُعِثْتُ لِأُتَمِّمَ صَالِحَ الأَخْلاقِ‏
> 
> I was sent to perfect good character."
> 
> { [Al-Adab al-Mufrad 14:273](https://sunnah.com/urn/2302710) }

Good manners will open the teacher up to the student, soften their hearts and lead them to sharing more.

Conversely, the teacher is likely to only give the minimum to the student with poor manners.

It is important to know what customs of the people of the area are, and what the shaykh expects from his students (without exaggerating in this regard).

**Examples of what would commonly be considered bad manners today:**

- reclining in the class
- stretching ones legs towards the teacher
- sleeping
- talking to ones friend
- not having ones books out and ready
- raising voice over the teacher
- don't stop talking when the teacher starts talking
- do not silence their phone, or worse they answer the phone
