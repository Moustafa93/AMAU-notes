# The Sixth Principle: Taking into Account the Different Sciences when Acquiring Knowledge, and Giving Precedence to Them in Order of Importance

The more knowledge you have of different sciences, the more complete your knowledge will be.

But this depends on two fundamental things:

## 1. Giving precedence to them in order of importance

This is what is meant by "تَقْدِيمُ الْأَهَمِّ". Putting the most important thing first.

It is blameworthy for a person to learn fasting eleven months before Ramadan, while they do not know how to pray, and the need for prayer is immediate.

[[Ibn al-Qayyim]] referred to such knowledge as "عِلْمُ الْحَالِ" - the knowledge that you need right now.

The shaykh quoted as evidence:

> [!quote] [[Imam Maalik]] said about seeking knowledge:
> حَسَنٌ جَمِيلٌ، وَلَكِنِ انْظُرِ الَّذِي يَلْزَمُكَ مِنْ حِينَ تُصْبِحُ إِلَى حِينَ تُمْسِي فَالْزَمْهُ
> 
> It is beautiful and good, but look at what you need from the time you wake until the time you reach evening, and stick to that.

## 2. Gradual progression in seeking knowledge

This is what is called "التَّدَرُّجُ فِي الطَّلَبِ" - Progressing step by step in seeking knowledge.

You start with a foundational text in every science. When a person has a strong foundation, the person chooses what to pursue based on what they enjoy and what the excel in.

A strong foundation in every science is required prior to specialisation. It takes much more time than one would expect to reach that stage.

Side benefit - annonymous poetry in Arabic is called Tayyaar al-Shi'r, or sometimes quoted with the term "lillahi darru al-qaa'il".

## Things that oppose this principle
- reluctance to study different types of knowledge
- belittling certain types of knowledge
- being busy with that which does not benefit
- fascination for oddities


> [!quote] [[Imam Maalik]] said
> شَرُّ الْعِلْمِ الْغَرِيبُ، وَخَيْرُ الْعِلْمِ الظَّاهِرُ الَّذِي قَدْ رَوَاهُ النَّاسُ
> 
> The worst knowledge is that which is strange, and the best knowledge is that which is manifest and widely transmitted by the people.

Examples of odd or irrelevant knowledge:

- What type of water destroyed the people of Nūḥ—salty or sweet?  
- What kind of dog belonged to the Companions of the Cave?  
- What type of stick did Mūsā have?  
- When an Imām was asked, “Is Iblīs married?” he replied: “I was not invited to the wedding.”
